  description: Rad-Gators are monstrous, mutated alligators that have adapted to the radioactive waters of the Houston bayous and swamps. They are larger and more aggressive than their pre-war counterparts, with gnarled, irradiated scales and glowing eyes.<br>They are ambush predators, often lurking just below the surface of murky waters, waiting to strike at unsuspecting prey. Their powerful jaws can deliver deadly bites.<br>Rad-Gators are most commonly found near bodies of water, making river crossings and swamp navigation perilous for unprepared travelers. They are especially common in the Buffalo Bayou.
