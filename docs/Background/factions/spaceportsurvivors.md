# The Spaceport Survivors

- **Overview:** The Spaceport Survivors are descendants of USSA astronauts, scientists, and military personnel who
  survived in a hidden vault beneath the Johnson Space Center.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Secret Vault: They operate from Vault 117, a hidden mission control center beneath the Johnson Space Center,
      preserving the legacy of space exploration.
    - Space Ambitions: The Spaceport Survivors are preparing for a historic manned rocket launch, the first of its kind
      since the Great War, as they aim to continue humanity's space exploration legacy.
- **Notable Figures:**
    - Director Catherine "Starborn" Caldwell: The visionary leader of the Spaceport Survivors, driven by the mission to
      revive space exploration.
    - Agent Victor "Stardust" Caldwell: A mysterious figure with ties to the Enclave, who is involved in secret
      machinations.
- **Conflict:** The Spaceport Survivors are focused on their mission, but they are not immune to the intrigues and
  hidden agendas within the wasteland, particularly from the Enclave.
- **Goals for Spaceport**:
    - Equipped with resources from their recent alliance with the Lone Star Republic, the Spaceport Survivors are
      preparing for a historic manned rocket launch. This launch represents the culmination of their efforts to revive
      space exploration and continue humanity's legacy in the post-apocalyptic world. Their goals for the spaceport are
      multi-faceted:
        - Symbol of Progress: The Spaceport Survivors see the spaceport as a symbol of progress and hope, showcasing
          humanity's ability to overcome the challenges of the post-apocalyptic world and achieve great feats.
        - Space Exploration: The spaceport represents an opportunity to continue humanity's legacy of space exploration,
          potentially finding new resources or safe havens beyond the wasteland.
        - Repairing existing satellites: The Spaceport Survivors aim to repair existing satellites, in an attempt to
          improve communication across the world.
    - The hidden Enclave cell within the Spaceport Survivors wish to hijack the mission (by way of placing crew members
      from within their own ranks) so to retake
      the [Ballistic Orbital Missile Base 001](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ballistic_Orbital_Missile_Base_001).
      Capturing this station would give this Enclave cell the ability to launch nuclear missiles at any target on the
      planet. This would be a major threat to any an all of the Enclave's enemies.
