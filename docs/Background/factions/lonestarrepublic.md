## History
### The Founding and Early Days (2254 - 2255)

In the wake of the devastating Great War of 2077, the region that was once Texas remained a perilous and chaotic wasteland. Survivors banded together in various settlements, each struggling to secure resources and establish some semblance of order. Among them were remnants of the pre-war Texas Rangers, a storied para-military organization that had continued its legacy of law enforcement since before the Great War.

In 2254, a coalition of these Rangers, driven by their shared Texan heritage and the desire to bring stability to the region, came together to form the Lone Star Republic. This confederacy of settlements aimed to unite the various communities in the Gulf Coast Wasteland under a common banner and to forge a future worth living.

### The Lone Star Republic-Cartel War (2255 - 2260)

The early years of the Lone Star Republic were fraught with challenges. The region was plagued by lawlessness, and ruthless cartels had taken control of Houston, terrorizing the population and exploiting valuable resources. The Lone Star Republic faced a daunting adversary.

Two notable figures who emerged as leaders during this tumultuous period were Maria Ramirez and Samuel Davis. Although not prominent political or military leaders initially, they both served as courageous and capable commanders in the early campaigns of the Lone Star Republic-Cartel War of 2255.

Maria "Ironclad" Ramirez earned her nickname for her unyielding resolve and determination in the face of adversity. Samuel Davis, a former Texas Ranger, provided his tactical knowledge and leadership in the field. Together, they led daring missions and strategic campaigns that helped turn the tide of the war.

The war was marked by valiant sacrifices, and it was during this time that Ramirez and Davis demonstrated exceptional bravery and leadership. Their deeds in the Lone Star Republic-Cartel War earned them promotions as Colonels in the Texas Rangers and set the stage for their future roles as key leaders in the Republic.

The war stretched on for several years, but through the combined efforts of the Republic's leaders, they eventually managed to liberate Houston from the clutches of the cartels. This victory secured valuable resources and settlements for the Lone Star Republic, cementing its reputation as a formidable regional power.

### The Post-War Years (2260 - 2284)

With the Lone Star Republic-Cartel War behind them, the Republic turned its attention to the challenges of rebuilding and governing the region. Many of the initial founders of the Republic transitioned into key political positions, having played instrumental roles in its formation and survival. A federal government structure was established, with a Senate and Congress representing the member settlements, as well as a President to oversee the executive branch.

Samuel Davis and Maria Ramirez, now distinguished veterans of the war, took on various responsibilities within the Texas Rangers and continued to contribute to the Republic's stability and security. They continued to lead military operations, oversee law enforcement, and ensure the safety of the Republic's citizens.

The Lone Star Republic faced challenges and conflicts with rival factions, particularly the Galveston Pirates, over control of vital resources. Their aggressive expansion led to increasing tensions in the wasteland, as the Republic sought to secure its interests and protect its growing population.

### Tension with the Oil Barons (2284-)

Although the Oil Barons had largely supported, and even financed to some extent, the Lone Star Republic's efforts to liberate Houston from the cartels, they had become increasingly concerned about the Republic's expansion and its growing influence. The Oil Barons were particularly wary of the Republic's ambitions to secure valuable resources, including energy sources, technology, and materials. They feared that the Republic's actions would threaten their own interests and ambitions. Consequently, they began to tighten their control over the region's energy resources including oil and nuclear energy. This limited the Republic's ability to expand, especially militarily, and led to increasing tensions between the two factions.

### The Lone Star Republic Election of 2285: General Samuel Davis vs. Alexander Sullivan

In 2285, the Lone Star Republic prepared for a significant election, as the incumbent Expansionist Party reached the end of its term with the sitting President, who had served the maximum allowable term and chose not to seek re-election. This set the stage for a competitive race, with the Expansionist Party looking to maintain its hold on power against the emerging Unity Party.

#### Candidates

 - General Samuel Davis/Isabella Torres (Expansionist Party): General Samuel Davis, a former leader of the Texas Rangers, had gained recognition for his heroic leadership during the Lone Star Republic-Cartel War of 2255. His strategic brilliance and commitment to the Republic's survival earned him respect and trust among the people. Seeking to leverage his military background, Davis ran for President with a platform focused on expanding the Republic's territory and securing valuable resources.Torres's expertise in diplomacy and foreign relations, combined with her pragmatic approach, complemented Davis's military leadership. Together, they formed a formidable team under the Expansionist Party banner.
 - Alexander Sullivan/Margaret "Maggie" Kane (Unity Party): Alexander Sullivan, a charismatic leader with a background in civil administration, emerged as the Unity Party's candidate for the presidency. He had served in various administrative roles within the Republic, which provided him with insights into its governance. Sullivan's campaign focused on unity, resource management, and environmental sustainability. Maggie Kane's background is diverse and dynamic, which has contributed to her broad appeal. She has held various positions within the Lone Star Republic, having served as a community organizer, a diplomat, and a member of the Congress before being selected as the Unity Party's Vice Presidential candidate. Maggie's diplomatic skills were honed during her tenure as an envoy to neighboring settlements, where she successfully negotiated trade agreements and fostered positive relations with other factions. Her diplomatic efforts aligned with the Unity Party's emphasis on cooperation and unity in the post-apocalyptic world.

#### Major Debate Topics

- Energy Crisis and Oil Barons: The tightening control of energy resources, both oil and nuclear, by powerful Oil Barons had become a critical issue. The Oil Barons' restrictive policies were limiting the Republic's ability to expand and improve its standard of living. General Davis and Vice President Torres advocated for a more assertive approach, seeking to negotiate better terms with the Oil Barons and exploring alternative energy sources.
- Territorial Expansion: A major campaign focus for General Davis and the Expansionist Party was the need for territorial expansion to secure new resources. They argued that the Republic's future hinged on acquiring additional settlements and resource-rich territories to support its growing population and energy needs.
- Unity and Diplomacy: Alexander Sullivan and the Unity Party emphasized unity, diplomacy, and the importance of fostering positive relations with neighboring factions. They believed that a cooperative approach would be more effective in securing resources and maintaining stability, without resorting to aggressive expansion.
- Security and Defense: General Davis stressed the need for a strong defense to protect the Republic's interests. He cited the dangers posed by rival factions and emphasized the importance of a well-equipped and trained military, which he had personal experience leading.
- Resource Management: Both parties acknowledged the importance of responsible resource management in the post-apocalyptic world. The Unity Party advocated for stricter resource conservation policies and sustainable practices, while the Expansionist Party focused on the acquisition of new resources to support the Republic's growing needs.

The election of 2285 was marked by passionate debates, campaign rallies, and a high level of civic engagement. It reflected the Republic's challenges and opportunities as it grappled with issues of energy, expansion, and diplomacy. Ultimately, the choice between General Samuel Davis's assertive expansionist vision and Alexander Sullivan's unity and sustainability platform lay in the hands of the Republic's citizens. 

#### Results
General Samuel Davis and Vice President Isabella Torres won the election by a narrow margin, securing the Presidency for the Expansionist Party. The Unity Party conceded defeat and pledged to work with the new administration to address the Republic's challenges. The election results were a testament to the Republic's democratic principles and the people's commitment to shaping their future.

Despite the narrow margin in the presidential election, their party won a majority of races for the Senate and Congress (albeit most individual races by a similarly narrow margin), giving them a strong mandate to pursue their agenda. The Expansionist Party's victory was a significant milestone for the Lone Star Republic, as it set the stage for a new era of expansion and growth.

### The Davis Administration (2285-)

It wasn't until 2288 that the Lone Star Republic's history took a new turn. The discovery of the spaceport and the ambitious goals associated with it would present a unique opportunity for the Republic. This potential resource windfall and symbolic endeavor would set the stage for the Republic's future as they embarked on a journey to secure their place in the Gulf Coast Wasteland and address its energy crisis, all under the leadership of President Samuel Davis.

Under the Davis Administration, Vault 117 was fast-tracked to annexation and being granted full representation in the Congress and Senate. This was controversial among many of the citizens of the Republic, but was largely supported by most leaders in the Lone Star Republic. The Lone Star Republic also began to expand its influence and secure new settlements, including the Vault 117 and the Spaceport Survivors. This expansion was met with mixed reactions from other factions, particularly the Galveston Pirates and the Oil Barons, who saw it as a threat to their control over the region's ports and trade routes.
