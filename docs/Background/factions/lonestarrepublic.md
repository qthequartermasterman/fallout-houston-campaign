# The Lone Star Republic:

## Overview
- **Overview:** The Lone Star Republic is a confederacy of settlements in the Gulf Coast Wasteland, centered around the
  region that was once Texas. They are known for their unified federal government and ambitious goals.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Federal Government: The Lone Star Republic is unique in its structure, with a centralized government that aims to
      unite various settlements under a common banner.
    - Resource Ambitions: Their primary focus is securing and controlling valuable resources, including energy, to
      support their growing population and prepare for a historic manned rocket launch.
- **Notable Figures:**
    - President Samuel Davis: The elected leader of the Lone Star Republic, responsible for making critical
      decisions about the faction's future.
    - General Maria "Ironclad" Ramirez: The military leader tasked with safeguarding the Republic's interests and
      enforcing its policies.
- **Conflict:** The Lone Star Republic often clashes with other factions, particularly the Galveston Pirates, over
  control of vital resources. Their aggressive expansion has led to increasing tensions in the wasteland.
- **Goals for Spaceport**:
  The Lone Star Republic sees the spaceport as a valuable asset with significant potential for the future of the Gulf
  Coast Wasteland. Their objectives regarding the spaceport are multi-faceted:

       - Resource Acquisition: The spaceport represents an opportunity to secure advanced technology, materials, and knowledge related to space exploration. The Lone Star Republic believes that these resources could be instrumental in addressing the region's energy crisis and technological limitations.
       - Symbol of Progress: Launching a manned rocket from the spaceport is not only a practical endeavor but also a symbolic one. The Lone Star Republic views it as a beacon of hope and progress, inspiring their people and showcasing their capabilities to the wasteland. They aim to demonstrate that humanity can still achieve great feats despite the post-apocalyptic challenges.
       - Exploration and Expansion: The spaceport offers the possibility of exploring uncharted territories, potentially finding untapped resources or safe havens beyond the wasteland. The Lone Star Republic envisions using space exploration to expand their influence and secure new settlements or alliances in the post-apocalyptic world.
       - Advancing Technology: The spaceport may hold pre-war technology and knowledge that could significantly advance the Lone Star Republic's technological capabilities. This could include advancements in energy production, advanced weaponry, or medical breakthroughs.

  In essence, the Lone Star Republic's goal is to leverage the spaceport's resources and capabilities to strengthen
  their position in the Gulf Coast Wasteland, address the region's energy crisis, and set the stage for a brighter
  future. The historic manned rocket launch represents their commitment to these objectives and their determination to
  lead the way in a world forever changed by the Great War.

    15. [Vault 117](./geography/neighborhoods.md#vault-117--mission-control): Vault 117 (under the remains of the Johnson Space
        Center) was recently annexed by the Lone Star
        Republic, providing them with access to the spaceport and its resources in exchange for full representation in
        the Senate and Congress. Although allying with the Spaceport Survivors was largely supported by most leaders in
        the Lone Star Republic, the decision to annex Vault 117 was controversial among many of the citizens of the
        Republic.
    16. [Radiant Shores (formerly Pearland)](./geography/neighborhoods.md#radiant-shores-formerly-pearland): Not a member settlement,

        in exchange for their loyalty.
    17. [Humble Haven (formerly Humble)](./geography/neighborhoods.md#humble-haven-formerly-humble-pronounced-with-a-silent-h): Not a
        member settlement, but due to its proximity to the airport, the Lone Star

        loyalty.
