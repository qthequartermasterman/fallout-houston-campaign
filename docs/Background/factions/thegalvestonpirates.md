# The Galveston Pirates

- **Overview:** The Galveston Pirates are a formidable force controlling key ports along the Gulf Coast. They are known
  for their ruthless tactics and control over sea routes.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Port Control: They effectively control trade routes and access to valuable resources through their control of
      Galveston's ports.
    - Pirate Raids: The Galveston Pirates regularly raid ships and coastal settlements, accumulating wealth and
      resources by force.
- **Notable Figures:**
    - Captain Sofia "Serpent" Vega: A respected pirate captain who commands several pirate crews and negotiates with the
      Cartel.
    - Rafael "El Diablo" SÃ¡nchez: The ruthless leader of the Cartel, who has a significant influence over the pirates.
- **Conflict:** The Galveston Pirates have an ongoing conflict with the Lone Star Republic, primarily over resource
  access. This rivalry fuels much of the region's instability.
- **Goals for Spaceport**:
    - The Galveston Pirates see the spaceport as a potential source of valuable resources, including advanced technology
      and materials. They aim to secure these resources by any means necessary, including raiding the spaceport or
      sabotaging the Lone Star Republic's efforts.
    - The Galveston Pirates also see the spaceport as a potential threat to their control over the region's ports and
      trade routes. They aim to prevent the Lone Star Republic from launching a manned rocket, which could give them a
      significant advantage in the wasteland. This could include sabotaging the launch or capturing the spaceport for
      themselves.
    - Although they are perfectly fine with the destruction of the spaceport, they would prefer to capture it for
      themselves. This would give them a significant advantage over the Lone Star Republic and the Spaceport Survivors.
      They would be able to use the spaceport to launch their own rockets, giving them the ability to exert control and
      intimidation over the wasteland and expand their influence. Additionally, they could use the spaceport's resources
      to improve their technology and weaponry, making them a formidable force in the region.
