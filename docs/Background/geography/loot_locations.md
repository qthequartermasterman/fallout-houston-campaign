# Scavenging Locations

<div id="map"></div>

The following locations are useful for providing opportunities for loot or dungeons. Generally, these locations tend 
not to be the location of significant story. For more details on the Scavenging system (including loot tables), consult
the *Fallout Core Rulebook* (p. 195).

Unless other information is provided, each of the locations in the list have no prescribed special features, and are 
included in the list solely to contain a geotag to be used on the auto-rendered map.

## Super Markets

Super Markets are a great place to find food, medicine, and other useful items. Super Markets are generally unmaintained and well-picked over. Often, they will be inhabited by raiders or other scavengers. For more details, consult the *Fallout Core Rulebook* (p. 244).

## Gas Stations

Gas Stations are a great place to find fuel, and sometimes food and medicine. Unlike in many other regions of the former 
United States, gas stations in the Gulf Coast Wasteland (due to the relative abundance of oil and nuclear fuels) are 
often still stocked and maintained. Those that are maintained will receive regular shipments of fuel from the Oil 
Barons, and will often have a small convenience store attached to them.

As the game master, you can decide whether a given gas station is maintained or not.
