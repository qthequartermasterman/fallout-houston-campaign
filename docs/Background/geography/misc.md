# Miscellaneous Notes on the Geography

### Rivers and Waterways

The region is crisscrossed by several rivers and waterways, including the Brazos River to the west and the San Jacinto
River to the east. These water sources play a crucial role in the distribution of freshwater and serve as natural
boundaries between different factions and territories.

### Radiation Zones

There are pockets of heavily irradiated areas throughout the Gulf Coast Wasteland, especially in proximity to former
military bases, nuclear power plants, and impact sites. These zones are extremely hazardous and require specialized
protective gear to navigate.

### Coastal Erosion

Due to the passage of time and environmental changes, coastal areas have experienced significant erosion. This has led
to the gradual encroachment of the Gulf of Mexico on the land, causing some pre-war coastal towns to become partially
submerged and transformed into dangerous, waterlogged ruins.

### Ruined Infrastructure

Pre-war highways, bridges, and tunnels have fallen into disrepair, with many sections completely collapsed. Traveling
through the Gulf Coast Wasteland often involves navigating around these obstacles, leading to the creation of makeshift
paths and detours.

### Wildlife

The wasteland is home to a variety of mutated wildlife, some of which are aggressive and territorial. Players will
encounter creatures like radstags, mutant alligators, irradiated insects, and more as they explore the wilderness.

### Islands

Off the coast of Galveston, several small islands and barrier islands can be found. These islands may contain hidden
caches, pirates' hideouts, or remnants of pre-war coastal facilities.

### Swamp Lands

The Bayou Swamps to the south and southeast of Houston are characterized by tangled vegetation, standing water, and
perilous terrain. Navigating these swamps can be challenging, but they offer unique resources and secrets for those who
dare to venture into them.

### Radiation Storms

The Gulf Coast Wasteland experiences occasional radiation storms, which can pose a severe threat to unprepared
travelers. Seek shelter or protective gear when a storm approaches.
