# Nuclear Targets

Some potential nuclear targets in the Houston area could include military and
government installations, as well as densely populated areas such as Downtown, Midtown, and the Medical Center. However,
without specific information about the Fallout universe's version of Houston and its geopolitical landscape, it is
difficult to determine the exact targets.

One particular target is Ellington Field, also known as Ellington Airport, is a joint civil-military airport located in
Houston, Texas. It serves as a base for both military and civilian aviation operations. The airport was primarily used
by
the Texas Air National Guard, the United States Coast Guard, and United States Space Administration (USSA). It also
supported general aviation and served as a reliever airport for Houston's larger commercial airports.

One additional target is USSA Mission Control (Johnson Space Center).
