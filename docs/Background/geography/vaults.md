Home of the Spaceport Survivors, Vault 117 is a unique vault that was designed to house the scientists and engineers
working at the Houston Spaceport. The vault was designed to be a self-sufficient facility, with its own power supply,
water purification system, and food production capabilities. It was also equipped with a state-of-the-art medical bay
and research laboratory, allowing the vault's residents to conduct experiments and develop new technologies, even in the
event of a nuclear war. The Vault is also unique in that it is equipped with an underground launch facility, allowing
its engineers to continue launching rockets for some time after the Great War. In addition to USSA employees, the vault
also ended up housing a number of defense and government contractors, as well as their families, including officials and
engineers from major Aerospace companies such
as [REPCONN Aerospace](../companies.md#repconn-aerospace), [Ball Aerospace](../companies.md#ball-aerospace), [Cosmic Voyage Innovations (CosV)](../companies.md#cosmic-voyage-industries-cosmicv)
and Vault-Tec.

Vault 117 was one of the first Vaults constructed as part of Project Safehouse (the government initiative, which in
conjunction with Vault-Tec became the Vaults), beginning construction in 2056 and concluding in 2066. The United States
Space Administration had already migrated all major operations (including all Mission Control operations) into the Vault
by 2067 (10 years before the Great War), only using the above-ground facilities for training and testing and
less-important/unclassified research.

When the Great War broke out in 2077, the Vault immediately went into lockdown mode, and all of its residents were
spared in the ensuing chaos. The spaceport had enough resources for two launches of the newly-developed Delta XII rocket
as well as smaller unmanned launches of their re-usable stock of Phoenix 7 and Phoenix Quantum rockets (developed by
CosmicV). One of the Delta XII rockets was used to rescue astronauts stranded on two space stations in Low Earth Orbit.
The other one was launched to the Moon on a secret mission, and her crew never returned.

In the intervening two centuries, Spaceport staff continued to maintain the network of satellites and orbital telescopes
that the USSA had launched prior to the Great War, launching and refurbishing unmanned Phoenix 7 rockets. The Spaceport
Survivors also continued to maintain the Vault's facilities and conduct research, including the development of new
technologies and the construction of a fleet of rockets to be used for future missions. The Vault was discovered
inhabited and forced open after a test flight for their upcoming manned Epsilon V rocket was shot down by Pirates.

## Vault 61 - Eternal Darkness Experiment

<geotag 
  latitude=30.191511890340102
  longitude=-95.44569062125957
  icon="VAULT"
  name="Vault 61"
/> 


- Purpose: Vault 61 was built to investigate the effects of perpetual darkness on human physiology and psychology,
  preparing residents for a world with limited light.
- Experience: Inhabitants of Vault 61 adapted to low-light conditions, developing keen night vision and heightened
  senses. They navigated the vault's dark halls, relying on sound and touch.
- Status: Vault 61 remains shrouded in darkness, its inhabitants preferring the cloak of night. They have developed a
  unique culture centered around stealth, and the vault serves as a refuge for those who cherish the shadows.
- Interaction: Vault 61 opened approximately 10 years ago, but its residents, having lived in darkness for several
  generations, are unable to tolerate the bright light of the outside world. Players can enter Vault 61, where they must
  adapt to perpetual darkness. They may uncover secrets hidden in the shadows or assist the vault's stealthy inhabitants
  in shadowy quests. The vault could be a refuge for characters with nocturnal abilities.
- Location: Situated beneath the Woodlands area, northeast of the Mall

## Vault 84 - Sleep Deprivation Experiment

<geotag 
  latitude=29.709986448341805
  longitude=-95.4032905456824
  icon="VAULT"
  name="Vault 84"
/> 

- Purpose: Vault 84 was designed to study the impact of chronic sleep deprivation on human cognitive function and
  interpersonal dynamics.
- Experience: Residents of Vault 84 struggled with irregular sleep patterns, leading to fatigue and heightened stress
  levels. They developed a rotating shift system to cope with sleep deprivation.
- Status: At first, Vault 84's residents have mastered the art of power napping and shift management. They remain
  vigilant in their sleep-deprived state, ensuring the vault's survival and contributing to their faction's efforts.
  Over time, however, the effects of sleep deprivation took their toll, leading to increased aggression and paranoia.
  Less than 10 years after the Vault closed, a small group of residents developed psychotic breaks and shared delusions,
  leading to a violent uprising. Convinced that they had been abducted by aliens and that the other residents were their
  captors, the group attacked their fellow residents, killing many of them. Although the rebels were eventually
  apprehended, the damage was done, and the survivors splintered into several factions, originally divided on how to
  handle the rebels. Worse, because the Vault's Overseer had been killed in the uprising, a successor was never
  successfully elected, and the irate, sleep-deprived residents broke out into a Civil War, leaving only a single
  survivor, who left holo-tapes detailing the Vault's fate.
- Interaction: Raiders opened Vault 84 approximately 70 years ago, finding all of its inhabitants dead.
- Location: Positioned beneath the Medical Center district in the heart of Houston

## Vault 99 - Hallucinogenic Horror Experiment

- Purpose: Vault 99 delved into the effects of potent hallucinogenic substances and twisted, disoriented architecture on
  human perception and behavior.
- Experience: Inhabitants of Vault 99 endured surreal and terrifying hallucinations, navigating a labyrinth of
  holographic tricks and nightmarish scenarios.
- Status: Vault 99 remains a twisted and disorienting place, its residents adept at discerning reality from illusion.
  Some have harnessed their experiences to become skilled illusionists in the wasteland.
- Interaction: The Vault opened about 50 years ago. It has some contact with the outside world, but most wastelanders
  are scared away by the psychedelic and uneasy feelings they have while in the Vault, so most tend to stay away.
- Location: Hidden deep below the Buffalo Bayou Park Cistern, an underground reservoir just west of downtown

## Vault 113 - Virtual Reality Matrix Experiment

<geotag 
  latitude=29.72250964302936
  longitude=-95.38816777155127
  icon="VAULT"
  name="Vault 113"
/> 

- Purpose: Vault 113 immersed residents in an intricate virtual world, isolating them from the physical realm to observe
  the long-term effects of simulated existence.
- Experience: Inhabitants of Vault 113 lived unaware of the outside world, their lives controlled by an advanced
  computer system, offering endless possibilities within the virtual realm.
- Status: Vault 113 remains a surreal and digital existence. Its residents continue to thrive within the simulated
  world, unaware of the true reality outside. Explorers uncover a complex virtual landscape with its own mysteries and
  challenges. The Overseer, an advanced AI, maintains order and ensures both the vault's physical survival and the
  entertainment of its residents, who have been in cryonic life support for over 200 years. Due to increasingly common
  malfunctions in the Vault, the Overseer has begun to look for a way to keep the Vault running, by sending robots out
  into the wasteland to scavenge for parts.
- Interaction: Vault 113 opened on schedule 10 years after the bombs fell, but none of its residents left. The
  occasional explorer has entered the Vault, but the Overseer has been able to keep most of them from discovering the
  truth. Only a handful of people have made it far enough into the Vault to discover the chamber where the residents are
  kept on life support, and only one has ever attempted to plug himself into the simulation. Players may enter the Vault
  and explore the virtual world, which is a mix of pre-war and post-war elements. They may also encounter the Overseer,
  who may ask them to help him keep the Vault running. Players may also encounter the aforementioned robots exploring
  the wastes.
- Location: Concealed beneath the ruins of the Houston Museum of Natural Science

## Vault 184 - Extreme Isolation Study

<geotag 
  latitude=29.772403427180695
  longitude=-95.80897805517826
  icon="VAULT"
  name="Vault 184"
/> 

- Purpose: Vault 184 focused on extreme isolation to understand the psychological impacts. Residents were isolated from
  one another and subjected to prolonged solitude and sensory deprivation.
- Experience: Vault 184 inhabitants endured extended periods of isolation, leading to heightened introspection, sensory
  sensitivity, and loneliness. Their lives were devoid of sensory input. Residents are permitted to socialize for only
  one month of every year, during a breeding season when they are allowed to interact with one another. Children remain
  isolated with their mother until they reach the age of 10, at which point they are separated and placed in isolation.
  Robots maintain the vault's operations, and residents are not permitted to interact with them. Despite their
  isolation, each vault-dweller maintains a role, including farming, cooking, etc...
- Status: Vault 184 is located on the west side of Houston, and its residents have adapted to solitude. They value their
  privacy and have developed unique coping mechanisms, making them resilient in their isolated environment.
- Interaction: Vault 184 was never intended to open up. Players may stumble upon it and find a group of people who are
  extremely wary of outsiders. They may be able to gain access to the Vault, but the residents will be extremely
  suspicious of them.
- Location: Beneath the remains of the former Katy Mills shopping center, to the west of Houston
