- The Bayou Outpost, a medium-sized settlement, is the Bayou Brotherhood's primary base of operations. It is located in the remains of the pre-war Buffalo Bayou Park, a former urban park Northeast of Downtown Houston. The bayou has reclaimed much of the park, turning it into a lush wetland.
- The settlement is situated around the Montrose Blvd overpass above the Buffalo Bayou. The Brotherhood has fortified the overpass and surrounding area, turning it into a defensible position. The bayou has reclaimed not just the strip of land around the river, but also the area north, encompassing the area around a secluded apartment complex on the west of Montrose Blvd and a small tower + pool complex on the east of Montrose Blvd.
- The tower is intentionally kept in a state of disrepair to avoid drawing the attention of outsiders, but acts as both a lookout post and as an easy landmark for members of the Brotherhood who canoe up and down the Bayou.
- The settlement's architecture consists of a combination of salvaged metal structures, wooden shanties, and makeshift walkways built on stilts to keep above the water and muck. Structures are often covered with moss and algae, giving them a weathered and camouflaged appearance. The entire settlement is surrounded by tall, twisted trees and dense, waterlogged foliage, making it difficult to spot from a distance, especially since the entire area is receded below the surrounding terrain and a thick fog often covers the area. As the settlement has grown, some residents have opted to repair parts of the apartment complex, but most of the settlement is still built on or around the river.
- The primary challenge for the inhabitants is dealing with periodic flooding caused by the rising and receding water levels of the swamp. Many structures have built-in drainage systems, and the settlers have become experts in managing water flow.
- Food is plentiful, with the bayou providing a variety of fish, crustaceans, and other wildlife. The settlers also cultivate crops in small hydroponic gardens and collect rainwater for drinking and cooking.
- There are about 30 people living in the settlement, including a few children. The settlers are a tight-knit community, and everyone contributes to the settlement's survival. They are wary of outsiders but are willing to trade with those who prove themselves trustworthy.
- The Bayou Outpost is led by Cyrus "Gator" Thibodeaux, a charismatic leader who is well-respected by the settlers. He is a former fisherman who has lived in the bayou his entire life and is an expert in navigating the swamp's treacherous waters. He is also a skilled hunter and fisherman, providing food for the settlement.
- A council of 4 elders assists Gator in making decisions for the community. The council is made up of the settlement's most experienced and respected members, including the Swamp Sage, a spiritual leader who guides the community in spiritual practices and rituals.

### Notable Locations

#### Montrose Overpass and the Bayou Bazaar

The heart of the Bayou Outpost is the Montrose overpass. This elevated structure, fortified by the Bayou Brotherhood, serves as the main hub of the settlement. It offers a commanding view of the surrounding bayou and is equipped with guard posts, lookout towers, and houses the Bayou Bazaar. At the center of the overpass is a large open area that serves as a communal gathering space for the settlers.

The Bayou Bazaar is the heart of the Bayou Outpost's trading and commerce. It's a bustling area where settlers, traders, and scavengers gather to exchange goods, resources, and stories.

- Stalls and Shacks: Various makeshift stalls and shanties line the wooden walkways above the swamp water, creating a vibrant marketplace. These structures are crafted from salvaged materials and display a variety of wares, from scavenged pre-war technology to mutated wildlife pelts and exotic bayou herbs.
- Trade Hub: The Bayou Bazaar is the central hub for trade and commerce within the settlement. Residents trade surplus food, weapons, and scavenged items in exchange for essentials like purified water, tools, and other valuable goods. The barter system is prevalent, and a sense of trust is vital in these transactions.
- Entertainment and Social Hub: In the evenings, the Bayou Bazaar transforms into an entertainment and social hub. Settlers gather to share stories, music, and dance, strengthening their community bonds and offering moments of respite in the harsh wasteland.
- The Waterfront: The market extends over the swamp waters, with platforms and shacks built on stilts. This unique feature allows traders to arrive by boat or canoe, expanding the trading network and providing the settlement access to goods from the broader bayou region.

The Bayou Outpost has its own unique calendar of cultural celebrations and rituals. These events often revolve around the changing seasons, the bayou's natural cycles, and the spiritual beliefs of the Swamp Sage. Residents gather to partake in dances, music, and storytelling during these special occasions.

#### Bayou Meadow Apartments

Named after a street sign found in the complex. On the west side of Montrose Blvd, nestled among the thick trees and marshy terrain, stands a once-secluded apartment complex. Some resourceful settlers have taken up residence here, meticulously repairing and fortifying their living spaces. The apartments serve as additional housing for the community that has outgrown its shanty-town origins, and they offer a stark contrast to the rest of the outpost, where most structures are built on or around the bayou.

#### Windsor Tower and Pool
Located on the east side of Montrose Blvd, a tall tower that appears dilapidated at first glance is another key landmark of the Bayou Outpost. Though it is intentionally left in a state of disrepair to avoid drawing unwanted attention, the tower serves as a lookout post for potential threats and a landmark for Bayou Brotherhood members navigating the bayou. A small, repurposed pool complex adjacent to the tower provides a source of cleaner water for growing some hydroponic crops.

#### The Hydroponic Gardens
To ensure a sustainable source of food, the settlers have established hydroponic gardens on the stilts and walkways that crisscross the swampy terrain. These gardens yield various crops, including irradiated ferns and mutated water lilies. These hydroponic gardens are a testament to the settlers' adaptability and resourcefulness.

#### The Gator's Den
Cyrus "Gator" Thibodeaux's personal quarters, known as "The Gator's Den," are a collection of interconnected shanties perched on stilts near the heart of the outpost, directly underneath the Overpass. This is where the settlement's leader plans and strategizes. His living space is adorned with trophies from his hunting and fishing endeavors, showcasing his prowess as a provider for the community.

#### Hydroelectric Generator
To harness the power of the bayou, the settlers have rigged a makeshift hydroelectric generator, located beneath the Montrose Overpass. This generator provides electricity for essential systems like lighting, water pumps, and communication equipment. Additional generators have been installed up and down the bayou, with power lines connecting them to the main generator.

#### Swampside Infimary
Positioned on the southside of the settlement, just off the Overpass and near the southern shore, the Swampside Infirmary is a modest, but vital structure where the outpost's only medic tends to the health needs of the residents. The infirmary is situated on stilts and is surrounded by various medicinal plants and herbs, carefully tended to by the settlement's healer. Inside, the small medical hut is well-organized, housing essential medical supplies salvaged from the wasteland.

- Healing Services: The settlement's medic, a skilled and compassionate individual, provides a range of medical services, including treating injuries, illnesses, and radiation exposure. They are also skilled in using natural remedies found in the bayou, making use of the local flora to create healing concoctions.
- Hydroponic Medical Garden: Adjacent to the medical hut is a hydroponic garden dedicated to growing medicinal herbs and plants. These are used to create poultices, tinctures, and other remedies, providing a renewable source of healing resources for the community.
- Quarantine Area: A section of the medical hut is set aside for isolating and treating individuals with contagious diseases or radiation poisoning, ensuring the well-being of the settlement remains a top priority.

#### Lower Residences/Montrose Quarters
Beneath the Montrose Blvd overpass, the Lower Residences, often referred to as Montrose Quarters, consist of a series of living spaces and shanties constructed on the ground level of the settlement, right below the elevated structure.

The majority of the settlement's residents, including families and individuals, reside in the Montrose Quarters. It is home to about two-thirds of the Bayou Outpost's population, making it a bustling and vibrant community. The Lower Residences are characterized by their tight-knit nature, with neighbors offering mutual support and a strong sense of camaraderie.

Despite the harsh and rustic appearance of the Lower Residences, the settlers have made these spaces as comfortable as possible. Each dwelling is equipped with salvaged furniture, sleeping quarters, and storage for personal belongings. Many residents have personalized their living spaces with unique touches that reflect their individual personalities and histories.

#### Swamp Ritual Grove

Nestled deep within the bayou, hidden away from the daily life of the settlement, is the Swamp Ritual Grove. This secluded area is known only to a select few in the Bayou Outpost, and it serves as a sacred space for spiritual and mystical rituals.

The Ritual Grove is an oasis of tranquility within the wild and unpredictable bayou. It is an open, natural clearing surrounded by ancient, towering cypress trees, their roots partly submerged in the dark, still waters of the bayou. Thick, hanging moss drapes from the branches, creating an otherworldly atmosphere.

In the center of the clearing, there's a simple shrine dedicated to the bayou's guardian spirits. The shrine is adorned with offerings like colorful beads, feathers, and small trinkets left by those who come to seek the Swamp Sage's guidance. Nearby, a stone altar is used for conducting various rituals and ceremonies. It's often covered with candles, herbs, and symbols representing the bayou's natural elements.

The Swamp Sage, a wise and revered figure within the settlement, leads the community in spiritual practices and offers guidance in times of need. The Swamp Sage, often adorned with robes and amulets made from bayou materials, conducts ceremonies, chants, and dances to communicate with the spirits and seek their blessings.

Surrounding the clearing are carefully tended herb gardens, containing rare and mystical flora believed to have special properties. These herbs play a significant role in the rituals and are harvested to create potions, remedies, and protective charms.

The Swamp Sage Ritual Grove is also a repository for ancient artifacts and knowledge passed down through generations. Weathered books, scrolls, and relics related to the bayou's spiritual history are stored here, preserving the community's connection to the past.

The Bayou Outpost's settlement reputation increases by 1 rank, and the players gain 1 AP. The shops at the Bayou Bazaar will have a wider variety of goods available for purchase, and the players will have access to a new shop at the other settlement. The players may also gain a new ally in the other settlement. Members of the other settlement may occasionally be seen at the Bayou Bazaar, and Brotherhood members may occasionally be found in the other settlement.
- **Peacefully negotiated informal agreement, but failed to negotiate trading contract or diplomatic relations:** If the PCs convince the rival settlement to agree to an informal arrangement, then the results of such an arrangement will be visible in the future. If the agreement is substatial, then the Bayou Outpost's settlement reputation may increase by 1 rank
- **Instigated tensions with the rival settlement:** If the PCs instigated tensions with the rival settlement, then the Bayou Outpost's settlement reputation decreases by 1 rank.

### Additional Landmarks
- The defensive wall surrounds the entire area of the former Rice University Campus. It is made of a combination of pre-war concrete and steel, and post-war scrap metal and wood. The wall is 20 feet tall. It is patrolled by Texas Rangers and has guard towers every 300 feet. The wall has 4 gates, one on each side of the campus. The gates are made of steel and are 10 feet tall and 10 feet wide. They are guarded by Texas Rangers and are closed at night. The gates are opened at dawn and closed at dusk.

Ellington Field is a significant location in the Gulf Coast Wasteland, especially due to its historical and strategic
importance. Here's more information about Ellington Field and its role in the post-apocalyptic setting:

### Pre-War History

Ellington Field, located to the southeast of Houston, was originally an active military installation used by the United
States military and NASA. It served as a hub for aerospace and aviation activities.
Before the Great War, the field was home to various military units, aviation schools, and research facilities. It played
a crucial role in supporting space exploration missions, as well as military training and operations.

Some members of the Enclave, a secretive pre-war organization that had infiltrated the US Government and Military, were 
stationed at Ellington Field. It was here that they conducted covert operations including the sabotage of the Vault-Tec 
mining facility on the Moon prior to the Battle of the Sea of Tranquility.

### Post-Apocalyptic Transformation

In the aftermath of the Great War, Ellington Field experienced a significant transformation. The once-thriving military
and aerospace hub fell into disrepair and disuse.
The field's runways and hangars, while still standing, have deteriorated over the years, and many of its buildings have
become shelter for survivors, scavengers, or even small factions.
While some of the old military equipment and aircraft may remain in various states of disrepair, they are often
cannibalized for spare parts or repurposed for makeshift defenses.
### Faction Interests

Ellington Field has attracted the attention of various factions in the Gulf Coast Wasteland due to its strategic
location, historical significance, and potential resources.
The Lone Star Republic may have established a presence at Ellington Field, using it as a staging area for military
operations or as a key location for safeguarding their territory.

location where they store or repair spacecraft components.
Other smaller factions or groups may have taken up residence in the field, using it as a base of operations, a trading
post, or a refuge from the dangers of the wasteland.
Gameplay Opportunities:

Ellington Field can serve as a pivotal location in the game's narrative, offering quests, challenges, or storylines tied
to the factions and resources present in the area.
The player may encounter diverse characters, from veteran pilots to engineers attempting to restore a semblance of
functionality to the field's facilities.

world and contribute to the player's survival.

- Humble's pre-war identity as a quiet suburban town has been reshaped by the harsh realities of the post-apocalyptic
  world. Its streets, once lined with tidy houses and local businesses, now feature a mix of improvised shelters,
  scavenged materials, and fortifications.
- Survivors of the Great War have banded together to form a close-knit community within the remnants of Humble. They
  refer to their settlement as "Humble Haven" and have built a shared sense of purpose based on mutual support and
  cooperation.
- The town's central square, once a gathering spot for community events and festivals, has been repurposed into a
  bustling marketplace. Here, residents and traders exchange goods, share stories, and negotiate trade deals, creating a
  sense of unity in the face of adversity.
- Humble Haven relies on a network of water wells and rain collection systems to provide a sustainable source of
  freshwater. This self-sufficiency has allowed the community to maintain a degree of independence and resist attempts
  at control by outside factions.
- The settlement maintains a vigilant watch against potential threats, as the region is home to mutated creatures and
  the occasional raider gang. Residents have developed defensive skills and strategies to safeguard their home.
- Positioned northeast of Houston, Humble Haven falls within the influence sphere of the Lone Star Republic. While the
  Republic has extended its protective umbrella over the settlement, tensions occasionally arise as Humble Haven seeks
  to maintain its autonomy.
- Because of its proximity with the International Airport, Humble Haven has become a strategic location for the Lone
  Star Republic. The Republic has established a military base at the airport, using it as a staging area for operations
  and a hub for intelligence gathering.
