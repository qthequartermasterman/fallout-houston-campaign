# Major Roads/Highways/Rails

## Interstate 10 and the Energy Corridor

- Interstate 10, which passes through Katy and the Energy Corridor, remains a crucial transportation route in the Gulf
  Coast Wasteland. However, portions of it have still suffered significant damage, including collapsed overpasses and
  debris.
- I-10 connects in the West to San Antonio, El Paso, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. It is not uncommon to see caravans and
  travelers moving along this route, transporting goods and resources between settlements. New California Republic (NCR)
  caravans sometimes will even travel as far as Houston along this route, which is largely passable most of the way to
  the West Coast. The occasional caravan from Caesar's Legion will also travel along this route, though they have little
  business or influence this far east.
- I-10 connects in the East to New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Mobile, and eventually Jacksonville.
- The Energy Corridor, with its concentration of oil and energy facilities, has a vested interest in maintaining access
  to Interstate 10. The Barons allocate resources to clear debris and fortify key sections of the highway to ensure the
  transportation of essential resources.
- Katy, as a major settlement along Interstate 10, has also invested in the maintenance and protection of this vital
  trade route. The settlement has become a hub for trade and transportation, connecting the Energy Corridor to other
  settlements and facilitating the movement of goods and resources.
- It remains one of the safest routes to travel across the Gulf Coast Wasteland, as the Lone Star Republic maintains a
  strong presence along Interstate 10, especially in the elevated portions that pass through the Downtown Ruins. The
  Republic's patrols and checkpoints ensure the safety of travelers and caravans moving along the highway.
- There is a distinct difference in the condition of Interstate 10 as it passes through the Energy Corridor and Katy.
  The Barons have invested resources in clearing debris and fortifying key sections of the highway, while the portion
  east of Downtown, although passable, is still in some disrepair.
- Harbor's Rest (formerly Bayton), Beaumont, and Port Arthur are major settlements along Interstate 10 in the east,
  serving as hubs for trade and transportation.

## Interstate 45

- Interstate 45, which passes through the Downtown Ruins, is a major transportation route in the Gulf Coast Wasteland.
  However, portions of it have suffered significant damage, including collapsed overpasses and debris.
- It connects to Dallas to the North, and Galveston to the South.
- Interstate 45 South is a major transportation route that connects the heart of Houston to the coastal city of
  Galveston. This stretch of the highway is a critical lifeline for both Houston and Galveston, facilitating trade,
  transportation, and the movement of people between the two cities.
- The highway passes through various post-apocalyptic landscapes, including ruined suburbs, overgrown forests, and
  makeshift settlements. Sections of the road have been repaired and maintained by local factions and settlements, while
  others remain in disrepair due to radiation, debris, and collapsed structures.
- Along this route, travelers encounter the remnants of pre-war society, such as abandoned vehicles, signage, and
  dilapidated roadside businesses. The highway also offers breathtaking views of the Gulf of Mexico, a reminder of the
  region's coastal heritage.
- For Galveston Pirates, controlling access to Interstate 45 South is of paramount importance, as it allows them to
  regulate trade, raid caravans, and maintain dominance over the vital route. Their presence and influence are
  particularly felt along this stretch, as they seek to extract tribute from passing travelers and maintain their
  stronghold on Galveston Island.
- Clear Lake Refuge, a hidden community of survivors, has established a presence along Interstate 45 South, using their
  knowledge of the area to navigate the treacherous terrain and provide safe passage for travelers.
- Because of the Spaceport's Proximity to I-45, the Lone Star Republic has made a priority to restore and maintain the
  highway between the Spaceport and Downtown. This stretch of the highway is a critical lifeline for the shuttling of
  supplies and personnel between the Spaceport and the rest of the Lone Star Republic
- Interstate 45 North, leading out of Houston and passing through the Woodlands, presents a mixed landscape of
  destruction and remnants of the past. Much of the highway is in a state of disrepair, with large sections of it
  demolished, collapsed, or heavily damaged from the Great War.
- In the Woodlands, which once boasted a vibrant and affluent suburban community, portions of I-45 have suffered
  significant damage. The overpasses and bridges that once spanned the highway have crumbled, leaving behind a maze of
  debris and obstacles.
- As travelers journey further north, they may encounter remnants of pre-war society, including abandoned vehicles,
  rusted billboards, and the remnants of roadside businesses. Some enterprising settlers have established shantytowns
  among the ruins, eking out a living from scavenged resources.
- Despite the challenges posed by the damaged highway, I-45 North still serves as a navigable route, albeit one that
  requires caution and resourcefulness. Caravans and travelers must often detour around collapsed sections, facing the
  dangers of radiation and hostile wildlife.
- The Woodlands, with its massive shopping mall and remnants of suburban life, stands as both a potential treasure trove
  of pre-war goods and a hazardous area due to pockets of radiation and marauding creatures.
- As Interstate 45 extends further north from the Woodlands, it reaches the towns of Conroe and Huntsville, each with
  its own unique post-apocalyptic character.
- This stretch of the highway continues to bear the scars of the Great War, with portions of it damaged or demolished.
  However, it remains a critical transportation route connecting these northern settlements to the remnants of Houston
  and the Gulf Coast Wasteland.
- Conroe, once a smaller suburban town, has seen a resurgence as a hub for agriculture and trade. The residents have
  repurposed portions of the highway for farming and as a marketplace where they trade surplus crops and goods with
  travelers and neighboring settlements.
- Huntsville, with its rich history, has transformed into a center of knowledge and education in the post-apocalyptic
  world. Sections of I-45 leading to Huntsville are adorned with makeshift signs directing travelers to a "Wasteland
  University," where knowledge and skills are shared and preserved.

further points west.
State: Parts of State Highway 6 have remained accessible for caravans and travelers, while others have suffered from
disrepair and damage.
Influence: Sugar Land, located along this highway, serves as a trading outpost for the New Liberty Trading Company (
NLTC). The highway facilitates trade between Sugar Land and other settlements, making it a crucial route for the NLTC's
operations. At the south, near the intersection of I-45 and SH-6, NLTC maintains a well-protected but small marina at
the
Bayou Vista, where their protected ships land. Although they do not use warships, the Galveston Pirates usually leave
them alone, after a few early, failed attempts to raid their ships. The NLTC has a small but well-armed security force,
and they are not afraid to use it.

## Interstate 610 (I-610)

Route: I-610, commonly referred to as "The Loop," encircles the city of Houston, forming a circular highway loop around
the urban center.
State: Sections of I-610 may be in varying states of disrepair, with some parts impassable due to damage. However, other
segments remain navigable, allowing for travel within and around Houston.
Influence: While I-610 itself does not directly connect to many settlements or key resource areas, it serves as a
strategic route for navigating Houston and reaching other highways that extend outward to the Gulf Coast Wasteland.
Various factions and scavengers may use it as a means of transit and for scavenging within the city.

## Beltway 8 (Sam Houston Tollway)

metropolitan area, extending far into the suburbs and surrounding regions.
State: Like other highways, portions of the Grand Parkway have suffered damage and disrepair. However, some segments are
maintained by local factions or settlements, especially those near valuable resources.
Influence: The Grand Parkway serves as a major transportation route connecting various settlements in the outer regions
of the Gulf Coast Wasteland. It facilitates trade, communication, and the movement of factions and travelers,
contributing to the region's interconnectedness.

## High-Speed Rail to Dallas (Out of Service)

Before the Great War, a state-of-the-art high-speed rail system connected Houston to Dallas, offering rapid
transportation between the two major Texan cities. However, this rail line has fallen into disrepair and is currently
out of service.
The high-speed rail terminals in both Houston and Dallas are now abandoned, with tracks overgrown and stations serving
as makeshift shelters for survivors. The reasons for the rail's disuse may vary, from lack of maintenance to resource
scarcity.
The remains of the high-speed rail serve as a reminder of the pre-war era's technological achievements and the
subsequent decline of infrastructure in the post-apocalyptic world. Travelers and scavengers sometimes venture along the
rail for shortcuts or resources.

## Freight Rail Lines (Repaired by the Barons)

The Oil Barons, with their significant economic influence and interest in resource management, have made efforts to
repair and maintain select freight rail lines connecting Houston to other major cities in Texas and beyond.
These freight rail lines play a critical role in the Barons' control over the transportation of valuable resources,
including oil, minerals, and other goods. They have secured sections of these rail lines, cleared debris, and
established fortified rail yards to protect their interests.
Freight trains operated by the Barons transport resources to and from Houston, facilitating trade and bolstering their
economic dominance. The rail lines also serve as a means of transporting essential goods to other settlements in the
Gulf Coast Wasteland.
The Barons strictly regulate access to these freight rail lines, and they are heavily guarded to prevent sabotage or
interference from rival factions. Travelers and settlers looking to use the freight rail must often negotiate with the
Barons for passage.

Stations:

1. Houston (Hub): Houston serves as the central hub for the Oil Barons' freight rail network. It connects to multiple
   rail lines heading in various directions.
2. Galveston (Coastal Port): One of the significant destinations from Houston's rail hub is the coastal town of
   Galveston. The rail line facilitates the transportation of goods to and from the Galveston port, making it a crucial
   point for maritime trade.
3. Harvest Haven (Formerly Conroe): The agricultural settlement of Harvest Haven relies on the freight rail to transport
   surplus crops and resources to Houston and other trade partners. It contributes to the Gulf Coast Wasteland's food
   supply.
4. Sugar Land (Trade Outpost): Sugar Land, a trade outpost maintained by the New Liberty Trading Company (NLTC),
   connects to the freight rail network, allowing the NLTC to transport goods to and from Houston and its trading
   partners.
5. Energy Corridor (Resource Center): The Oil Barons use the freight rail lines to transport valuable resources,
   including oil and minerals, from the Energy Corridor to Houston. This resource-rich area is a significant source of
   the Barons' power and wealth.
6. The Corpse (Corpus Christi): While not part of the main story, The Corpse could be connected to the rail network in a
   potential downloadable content (DLC) expansion. This connection would facilitate trade and exploration to the south.
7. San Antonio: The freight rail line connecting Houston to San Antonio is a vital route for transporting goods and
   resources between the two cities. It also acts as a hub for Baron trade operations west to Phoenix and North to
   Austin. They aspire to push this line all the way west to It is also a potential route for travelers and caravans
   moving between the Lone Star Republic and the New California Republic (NCR).
8. Port Arthur Outpost: The Port Arthur Outpost, a settlement established by survivors who once worked in the shipping
   and maritime industry, relies on the freight rail to transport goods and resources to Houston and other trade
   partners.
9. New Orleans (Future): The Barons are attempting to establish a freight rail line connecting Houston to New Orleans, a
   major
   port city beyond the Gulf Coast Wasteland. This line would facilitate trade and transportation between the two
   cities, making it a valuable asset for the Barons.
10. Dallas (Future): The Barons are reviving the freight rail line connecting Houston to Dallas, a major city in the
    Lone Star
    Republic. This line would facilitate trade and transportation between the two cities, making it a valuable asset for
    the Barons.

The Barons secure the freight rail lines by establishing fortified rail yards along the routes. These rail yards serve
as checkpoints where the Barons can inspect and regulate the flow of goods and resources. They also provide a means of
protecting the rail lines from sabotage or interference by rival factions.

  forests, rolling hills, and rocky terrain. It's home to various mutated wildlife, including aggressive radstags and
  feral predators. The area is known for its remote beauty and resources, attracting hunters and adventurers.
- Brazos Bend State Park: This former state park, located southwest of Houston, has transformed into a wild and untamed
  natural sanctuary. The park's marshes, lakes, and dense woodlands are now inhabited by mutated wildlife. The park's
  visitor center and observatory have become makeshift shelters for survivors.
- Bolivar Peninsula: Situated to the east of Galveston, the Bolivar Peninsula is a windswept region with expansive
  beaches and rolling sand dunes. The area is known for its isolation and the remnants of beachfront properties. It is
  also a strategic location for trade with the Portside Shantytown.
- The Swampy Lowlands: These low-lying areas, scattered throughout the region, consist of flooded plains, overgrown
  vegetation, and stagnant waters. The Swampy Lowlands are a challenging environment to navigate due to the risk of
  radiation and mutated creatures. However, they may hide hidden caches of pre-war technology.
