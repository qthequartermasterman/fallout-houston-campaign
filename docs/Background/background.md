# Background Events to Fallout: Houston

This Prologue explains the events occurring the Gulf Coast Wasteland in the years leading up to the campaign. It is
intended to be read by the Gamemaster, and is not necessary for players to read. It provides additional context for the
story.

## Discovery of the Spaceport Survivors

For the last two centuries, the Spaceport Survivors have been living in a Vault-Tec Vault 117 built underneath the ruins
of the Johnson Space Center. As part of their operations to maintain the satellite infrastructure and research
established before the Great War, the Spaceport Survivors have been routinely (2-3/year) launching rockets from a
hidden, underground launch pad. These launches are unmanned, and are used to deploy or repair satellites or perform
research.

On 6 June 2288, T+2:11 minutes after lift-off of a Phoenix VII from the Vault 117 Launch silo, the Galveston Pirates
noticed what they assumed to be a missile, fired artillery and destroyed the rocket. The Spaceport Survivors, who had
been monitoring the launch from the Vault 117 control room, were shocked and horrified. They had no idea who had fired
on them, and they had no idea why. They had been launching rockets for over 200 years, and no one had ever fired on them
before. 

Suspicious of the launch, the Galveston Pirates sent a small team to investigate both the launch site and the debris. They found the remains of the rocket, and they found the remains of the payload, which was a communications satellite rigged as a relay. They were able to recover enough of the satellite to turn it on, and it began receiving and re-broadcasting a signal from the Spaceport's network. The Pirates were able to trace the signal back to a surface antenna, near which they found a maintenance hatch leading into Vault 117. 

On 14 June 2288, when the Spaceport Survivors detected the intrusion and knowing that they had no way to defend themselves, they sent a wide-frequency broadcast to the entire Gulf Coast Wasteland, asking for help. The Lone Star Republic, the Oil Barons, and the Bayou Brotherhood all heard the broadcast, and they all sent teams to investigate. The Galveston Pirates, who had already discovered the Vault, also sent a team to investigate. Ultimately, the Lone Star Republic was the first to arrive, and they were able to establish contact with the Spaceport Survivors and fended off the Pirate intruders. For the first time since shortly after the Bombs fell, Vault 117 opened its vault door, and the Spaceport Survivors emerged into the Gulf Coast Wasteland, meeting the Lone Star Republic for the first time.

## Establishing Diplomatic Relations with the Lone Star Republic

The Lone Star Republic was the first to arrive at Vault 117, and they were able to establish contact with the Spaceport Survivors. The Lone Star Republic was able to convince the Spaceport Survivors that they were not hostile, and they were able to establish a trade agreement. The Lone Star Republic would provide the Spaceport Survivors with food, water, and other supplies (particularly for building and launching rockets), and the Spaceport Survivors would provide the Lone Star Republic with advanced technology and access to the communications satellites in orbit. 

The Lone Star Republic also provided the Spaceport Survivors with a security force, which was used to defend the Spaceport Survivors from the Galveston Pirates. After several months, under dubious circumstances, the Lone Star Congress and Senate controversially voted to admit the Vault 117 as a member settlement of the Republic, giving them voting rights in the legislature.
