## Quest 4: Lone Star Ambitions
*Available after completing Quest 2: Diplomatic Relations. Can be performed in any order with Quest 3: Pirates' Plunder.*
### Summary

- The Lone Star Republic contacts the player and requests their assistance.


### Plot
#### The Call to Rice Village
- The player, having already established themselves in the Gulf Coast Wasteland through previous quests, receives a message to meet a representative of the Lone Star Republic in Rice Village. Depending on their previous actions, the nature of the message varies:
    - If the player helped the Bayou Brotherhood in Quest 1, Theodore Wilcox, a congressman representing Harbor's Rest (formerly Baytown) greets the player, praising their reputation among the Bayou Brotherhood. A courier delivers the message.
    - If the player helped the Lone Star Republic in Quest 2, the President himself acknowledges the player's heroic efforts at the Spaceport and sends a message. A courier delivers the message. 
    - Both of the above may apply, in which case both the Congressman and the President greet the player.
    - Otherwise, a General of the Texas Rangers broadcasts a message, seeking mercenaries and couriers for a well-paying job. This is a generic message sent to all potential hires.
- The message instructs the player to meet a Lone Star Republic negotiator at Rice Village's town square.
#### Rice Village Arrival
- The player arrives at Rice Village, the de facto capital of the Lone Star Republic. Depending on the nature of the message they received, they are greeted differently:
    - If the player helped the Bayou Brotherhood, the congressman representing Harbor's Rest welcomes the player, referring to their prior actions. He introduces the player to the Lone Star Republic negotiator, Sarah Dawson, and their mission.
    - If the player helped the Lone Star Republic, the President personally acknowledges the player's presence and thanks them for their previous assistance. He introduces the player to negotiator Sarah Dawson and explains the importance of the upcoming mission.
    - If the player responded to the general broadcast, they are met by a Lone Star Republic general who provides a brief overview of the mission and introduces Sarah Dawson.
#### The Negotiation
- Sarah Dawson explains the mission: to negotiate the purchase of a Fusion Core Stabilizer from the Oil Barons, under the guise of improving electricity stability in the Lone Star Republic's northern settlements.
- The player, accompanied by Sarah, heads to Western Reach, the settlement housing the headquarters of the Oil Barons.
- At Western Reach, they meet with Leonard "Ironclad" Duvall, a high-ranking member of the Oil Barons. Duvall is initially skeptical of the Lone Star Republic's intentions but is willing to negotiate.
- The negotiation takes place, and Duvall presents two offers: selling oil at a discounted rate or providing fusion cores. Sarah must persuade Duvall to sell the Fusion Core Stabilizer.
#### Securing the Stabilizer
- The player and Sarah successfully negotiate with Duvall, convincing him of the importance of the Fusion Core Stabilizer for  energy stability in the region. The Oil Barons agree to sell it to the Lone Star Republic.
- The player is entrusted with the Fusion Core Stabilizer, and they, along with Sarah, embark on their journey to deliver it - to the Spaceport. 
- (Without the game-master telling the player), the player must take an indirect route that first goes Northward to not blow their cover. They must avoid the Galveston Pirates, who are still interested in the Spaceport.
    - If the player takes non-initially-northern route, then they are accosted by mercenaries sent by the Oil Barons, including a high-up Oil Barons leader with an angry message from Duvall. The mercenaries attempt to take the Fusion Core Stabilizer by force, unless the player can convince them otherwise.
    - If the player takes a route that is initially south or south-east, then they are accosted by Galveston Pirates, who are still interested in the Spaceport. The Pirates attempt to take the Fusion Core Stabilizer by force, unless the player can convince them otherwise.

#### Quest Rewards
- Experience points for completing quest objectives.
- Reputation changes based on the player's choice.
    - If the player successfully delivers the Fusion Core Stabilizer to the Spaceport, then they gain favor with the Lone Star Republic and the Spaceport Survivors.
    - If the player tactfully negotiates a deal with the Oil Barons (i.e. they do not use force or intimidation to obtain the Fusion Core Stabilizer), then they gain favor with the Oil Barons.
- Access to additional faction-related quests for the faction(s) the player supported.

### Purpose
This quest further explores the Lone Star Republic's resource ambitions and introduces the player to the Oil Barons.

## Quest 5: Visions of Betrayal
*Available after completing Quest 3: Pirates' Plunder and Quest 4: Lone Star Ambitions.*
### Summary

- The player's recurring visions become more frequent and vivid, revealing a betrayal within the Spaceport Survivors. They witness a clandestine meeting between a Spaceport Survivor and an Enclave agent.
- The player seeks out Agent Victor "Stardust" Caldwell, a mysterious figure within the Spaceport Survivors, in hopes of uncovering the truth behind their visions. Stardust hints at the Enclave's involvement and suggests that the Spaceport Survivors are divided over their true mission.
- The player is presented with a choice: continue to gather evidence and confront the Enclave, or share their suspicions with the Lone Star Republic or Galveston Pirates.
- Purpose: This quest deepens the player's understanding of the Enclave's presence within the Spaceport Survivors and the faction's internal conflicts.

### Plot
#### The Mysterious Vision
- The player's vision takes them to the Moon, where their great-great-grandfather is shown standing in front of a control panel in the lunar base. He appears conflicted and is having a conversation with another astronaut.
- In the vision, the astronaut's face is obscured, and their voice is distorted, making it impossible to identify them or hear the conversation clearly. However, the player senses an air of secrecy and tension.
- As the vision continues, the player's great-great-grandfather makes a choice to override a system, which results in a loss of communication with the lunar base. The astronaut's distorted voice seems to express both concern and frustration.
- The vision ends with a sense of foreboding, leaving the player with the impression that there was a hidden agenda or conspiracy even during the Moon mission.
#### Seeking Stardust's Assistance
- The player, intrigued and unsettled by the vision, seeks out Agent Victor "Stardust" Caldwell within the Spaceport Survivors. They believe that Stardust, as an insider, may have knowledge about the vision and its connection to their great-great-grandfather's campaign.
- Stardust is initially cautious and puzzled by the player's inquiry. He explains that he doesn't understand their origins or significance, but has suspected for some time that certain parties with the Starport may be acting on a secret, hidden agenda. Stardust is unaware of the Enclave's presence within the Spaceport Survivors.
- However, Stardust suggests that the player's unique perspective as an outsider might be valuable for uncovering any hidden agendas within the Spaceport Survivors.
    - If the player is on good terms with the Spaceport Survivors and/or the Lone Star Republic, then Stardust is more trusting of the player and is willing to share the identities of a few Spaceport Survivors of whom he is suspicious.
    - If the player successfully delivered the Fusion Core Stabilizer to the Spaceport in Quest 4, then Stardust is more trusting of the player, and is willing to share more information, including that security logs show that the suspicious Spaceport Survivors tend to meet in a certain (hidden) storage chamber deep within Vault 117.
#### Investigating the Conspiracy
- Stardust provides the player with a keycard (which grants some security clearance). He hopes that the player's investigation can shed light on the visions and discover the truth behind the suspicious members' activities.
    - If Stardust told the player about the hidden storage chamber, then the keycard he gives the player has Level 3 Clearance and can access the chamber.
    - Otherwise, the keycard has Level 2 Clearance and can access most of the Spaceport, but not the hidden storage chamber. Players will have to find the chamber on their own, as well as a way to access it.
- The player investigates the hidden storage chamber and uncovers evidence of a plan to hijack the space mission for their own sinister purposes. They also find hints that suggest the Spaceport Survivors are not unified in their goals, and some may be complicit with an outside force.
- As the player continues their investigation, they inadvertently set off an alarm, alerting the Spaceport Survivors loyal to the conspiracy. The player must escape the area before being apprehended.
#### The  Nefarious Plot
- The player escapes the hidden chamber and returns to Stardust with their findings. Stardust is shocked by the evidence the player has uncovered.
    - The player may choose to reveal any amount of information to Stardust. The more information they reveal, the more concerned Stardust becomes.
- Stardust believes that the player's visions are connected to their great-great-grandfather's role in the Sea of Tranquility campaign and to the hidden agenda the player had begun to uncover. He encourages the player to return to the Bayou Brotherhood and seek their guidance in interpreting the visions. He also tells the player that it may be worth investigating nearby pre-war military installations for additional clues.
- Stardust tells the player that he will continue investigating the conspiracy, and will contact them shortly to ask for additional help.

### Quest Rewards
- Experience points for completing quest objectives.
- Reputation changes based on the player's choice.
    - If the player chooses to share their findings with Stardust, they gain favor with the Spaceport Survivors and the Lone Star Republic.
- Spaceport Security Keycard (Level 3), which grants access to the Spaceport's restricted areas.
- Spaceport Security Energy Weapon, a unique weapon with a special ability.

### Purpose
This quest reveals the first definite evidence that there exists a conspiracy among the Spaceport Survivors and that an outside force is involved. This conflict sets the stage for the reveal of the Enclave in Quest 6 and for the conflict that will drive faction quests in Act 2.




## Quest 6: Unveiling the Conspiracy
*Available after completing Quest 5: Visions of Betrayal.*

### Plot
#### Seeking Guidance in the Bayou (Optional Subquest)

- The player, overwhelmed by recurring visions and their growing complexity, decides to return to the Bayou Brotherhood and consult with Ezekiel "Swamp Sage" Thibodeaux.
- Swamp Sage advises the player on harnessing their visions' power and suggests visiting an ancient Bayou site to gain clarity.
- The player's visit to the sacred site results in a vision that hints at the Enclave's involvement but does not reveal their identity.
#### A Frightening Revelation

- The player, now aware of an impending conspiracy within the Spaceport Survivors, seeks to uncover the true identity of the external force manipulating events.
- While investigating, the player discovers a hidden Enclave facility underground at Ellington Field, a former joint military base.
- The facility contains critical documents and logs related to the Sea of Tranquility attack, confirming the Enclave's involvement.
    - Artifacts include:
    - A recording of two astronauts arguing during the Sea of Tranquility mission, revealing that the Enclave was responsible for the attack.
    - A log of Enclave members in the Sea of Tranquility mission, including the identity of the astronaut who betrayed the player's great-great-grandfather.
    - A log of Enclave members slated for residency in Vault 117 before the Great War.
    - Blueprints for the orbital space station, revealing that the Enclave was involved in its construction.
    - etc...
  
#### Espionage and Secrets

- Unbeknownst to the player, agents from the Pirates and the Barons have been covertly observing the player's actions after leaving the Spaceport and have followed them to Ellington Field.
- As the player infiltrates the Enclave facility, these agents witness the player's findings.
- Perceptive players may notice one or more of these agents and confront them.
- While the player is in the Enclave facility, they receive a message from Stardust stating that he has uncovered additional information about the conspiracy and needs the player's help. He also asks the player for a status update on their investigation.
- The agents (if they can manage to do so before being detected) send a message to their respective factions, informing them of a conspiracy involving the Enclave and the Spaceport Survivors.
    - If the player does not destroy the Enclave facility, then the agents also investigate the facility themselves, sharing any information they find (i.e. everything the player did not remove from the facility) with their respective factions.
- Stardust informs the President of the Lone Star Republic about a conspiracy among some of the Spaceport Survivors and potential Enclave involvement.

#### Confronting the Enemy Within
- When the player returns to the Spaceport, they find Stardust and the Lone Star President waiting for them in a secure chamber adjoined with the Overseer's office in Vault 117. 
- They explain to the player that thanks to the player's help, Stardust was able to uncover additional evidence about the conspiracy, including encrypted communications from those suspicious members with persona in the Oil Barons that Ranger Intelligence had previously identified as potential Enclave agents. 
    - Rangers had begun investigating potential Enclave influence in the Gulf Coast Wasteland after events on the West Coast in 2242 and in the Capital Wasteland in 2277 showed that the Enclave was still active. 
    - New California Republic reports of Enclave activity connected to Poseidon Energy had in particular prompted the Rangers to investigate the Oil Barons. 
    - Their intelligence holds that potential Enclave influence within the Oil Barons is small, but nontrivial, and it is unclear how far up the chain of command it goes.
- The President feels that it is important to arrest the potential conspirators immediately and investigate them, even if there is not yet enough evidence to convict them. Stardust, insisting that these men, even if they are traitors, are his colleagues, insists that they need more concrete evidence before taking action.
    - The player might:
        - Agree with the President and help arrest the potential conspirators immediately.
            - The player and a squad of Texas Rangers confront several potential conspirators who are meeting in the hidden Enclave chamber deep within Vault 117. The conspirators are arrested and taken into custody.
            - If the Oil Barons have been previously informed by their agent about the Enclave conspiracy, then Enclave agents within the Barons send a notification to the conspirators within the Spaceport, of whom some manage to escape, the others are frantically trying to hide evidence, and are found in the process in the hidden Enclave chamber.
        - Persuade them to wait some time to gather more evidence.
            - A few Enclave conspirators, noticing that something is awry while investigations happen, manage to escape, hiding some evidence.
            - Evidence of the Enclave conspiracy is found in the private quarters of several of the suspicious conspirators, and they are arrested.
        - Refuse to help arrest the potential conspirators
            - The squad of Texas Rangers confronts the potential conspirators without the player's help. The conspirators are arrested and taken into custody.
            - If the Oil Barons have been previously informed by their agent about the Enclave conspiracy, then Enclave agents within the Barons send a notification to the conspirators within the Spaceport, of whom some manage to escape, the others are frantically trying to hide evidence, and are found in the process in the hidden Enclave chamber.
- The arrested conspirators are escorted out of the Spaceport by the Rangers, and the President thanks the player for their help. He asks the player to keep an eye out for any additional evidence of Enclave involvement.
#### Faction Conflict Ignites
- Word spreads quickly across the Wasteland of a mass arrest at the Spaceport. Each faction connects the dots (based on their agents' reports earlier in the Quest and rumors of the player's actions in the arrests).
- The factions, now aware of the Enclave's involvement, react based on the information provided by the player or their agents.
  - The Lone Star Republic views the Enclave as a dire threat to their space mission and seeks immediate action.
  - The Galveston Pirates see the Enclave as a potential ally, hoping to use their orbital weapon, believing it could be a valuable asset in their quest for power.
  - The Bayou Brotherhood sees the Enclave as a cosmic force disrupting the natural order and considers joining forces with the Lone Star Republic to eliminate this threat.
  - The Oil and Energy Barons are divided, with some seeing the Enclave as an opportunity for an alliance and others viewing them as a risk to their own ambitions.
