# Big Bend

Big Bend is a campaign that takes place in the remains of the Big Bend National Park. In this campaign, players continue interacting with the Cartels, but for the first time interact with their leaders while the Cartels clash with Caesar's Legion (which has been expanding into New Mexico and West Texas).
