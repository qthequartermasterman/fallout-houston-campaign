# Rustlers' Reckoning

In this campaign players help as cowboys in a cattle drive from Houston into Legion territory. The majority of the plot occurs in the remains of the Big Bend National Park. In this campaign, players continue interacting with the Cartels, but for the first time interact with their leaders while the Cartels clash with Caesar's Legion (which has been expanding into New Mexico and West Texas).
