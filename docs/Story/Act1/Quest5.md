*Available after completing Quest 3: Pirates' Plunder and Quest 4: Lone Star Ambitions.*

## Setting
[Spaceport District](../../Background/geography/neighborhoods.md#spaceport-district-johnson-space-center)


## Plot
### The Mysterious Vision
- The player's vision takes them to the Moon, where their great-great-grandfather is shown standing in front of a control panel in the lunar base. He appears conflicted and is having a conversation with another astronaut.
- In the vision, the astronaut's face is obscured, and their voice is distorted, making it impossible to identify them or hear the conversation clearly. However, the player senses an air of secrecy and tension.
- As the vision continues, the player's great-great-grandfather makes a choice to override a system, which results in a loss of communication with the lunar base. The astronaut's distorted voice seems to express both concern and frustration.
- The vision ends with a sense of foreboding, leaving the player with the impression that there was a hidden agenda or conspiracy even during the Moon mission.
### Seeking Stardust's Assistance
- The player, intrigued and unsettled by the vision, seeks out Agent Victor "Stardust" Caldwell within the Spaceport Survivors. They believe that Stardust, as an insider, may have knowledge about the vision and its connection to their great-great-grandfather's campaign.
- Stardust is initially cautious and puzzled by the player's inquiry. He explains that he doesn't understand their origins or significance, but has suspected for some time that certain parties with the Starport may be acting on a secret, hidden agenda. Stardust is unaware of the Enclave's presence within the Spaceport Survivors.
- However, Stardust suggests that the player's unique perspective as an outsider might be valuable for uncovering any hidden agendas within the Spaceport Survivors.
    - If the player is on good terms with the Spaceport Survivors and/or the Lone Star Republic, then Stardust is more trusting of the player and is willing to share the identities of a few Spaceport Survivors of whom he is suspicious.
    - If the player successfully delivered the Fusion Core Stabilizer to the Spaceport in Quest 4, then Stardust is more trusting of the player, and is willing to share more information, including that security logs show that the suspicious Spaceport Survivors tend to meet in a certain (hidden) storage chamber deep within Vault 117.
### Investigating the Conspiracy
- Stardust provides the player with a keycard (which grants some security clearance). He hopes that the player's investigation can shed light on the visions and discover the truth behind the suspicious members' activities.
    - If Stardust told the player about the hidden storage chamber, then the keycard he gives the player has Level 3 Clearance and can access the chamber.
    - Otherwise, the keycard has Level 2 Clearance and can access most of the Spaceport, but not the hidden storage chamber. Players will have to find the chamber on their own, as well as a way to access it.
- The player investigates the hidden storage chamber and uncovers evidence of a plan to hijack the space mission for their own sinister purposes. They also find hints that suggest the Spaceport Survivors are not unified in their goals, and some may be complicit with an outside force.
- As the player continues their investigation, they inadvertently set off an alarm, alerting the Spaceport Survivors loyal to the conspiracy. The player must escape the area before being apprehended.
### The  Nefarious Plot
- The player escapes the hidden chamber and returns to Stardust with their findings. Stardust is shocked by the evidence the player has uncovered.
    - The player may choose to reveal any amount of information to Stardust. The more information they reveal, the more concerned Stardust becomes.
- Stardust believes that the player's visions are connected to their great-great-grandfather's role in the Sea of Tranquility campaign and to the hidden agenda the player had begun to uncover. He encourages the player to return to the Bayou Brotherhood and seek their guidance in interpreting the visions. He also tells the player that it may be worth investigating nearby pre-war military installations for additional clues.
- Stardust tells the player that he will continue investigating the conspiracy, and will contact them shortly to ask for additional help.

## Quest Rewards
- Experience points for completing quest objectives.
- Reputation changes based on the player's choice.
    - If the player chooses to share their findings with Stardust, they gain favor with the Spaceport Survivors and the Lone Star Republic.
- Spaceport Security Keycard (Level 3), which grants access to the Spaceport's restricted areas.
- Spaceport Security Energy Weapon, a unique weapon with a special ability.

## Purpose
This quest reveals the first definite evidence that there exists a conspiracy among the Spaceport Survivors and that an outside force is involved. This conflict sets the stage for the reveal of the Enclave in Quest 6 and for the conflict that will drive faction quests in Act 2.
