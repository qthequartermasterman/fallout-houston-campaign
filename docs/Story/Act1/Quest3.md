## Plot

### The Proposal
1. The player receives a message from an intimidating figure in a tri-corn hat
    - If the player helped the Pirates in Quest 2, then the message reads, 
   
        > "Ahoy, matey! You proved yourself useful before, and I reckon you could be of some help again. We've got our eyes set on a big prize, and we need someone with your skills to gather some information for us. Come meet me in Galveston if you're interested."

    - If the player did not help the Pirates in Quest 2, then the message reads, 

        > "You've caused us some trouble, but we reckon you might be redeemed yet. We've got an offer for you, and you'd better hear it out. Meet me in Galveston if you want to make amends."

2. The player travels to Galveston to meet with Captain Sofia "Serpent" Vega.
    - Upon meeting the Captain, she explains their plan to raid the Spaceport and their need for inside information.
    - She presents the player with a choice: accept the proposal and infiltrate the Spaceport, or decline and potentially face the consequences. 
    - 
### Acting on the Proposal

1. Accepting the Proposal:
    - Infiltrating the Spaceport:
       - If the player chooses to accept the Pirates' proposal, they infiltrate the Spaceport and gather intel on its defenses and potential loot.
       - While inside, the player discovers the Spaceport Survivors' plans for a manned space mission, revealing the true significance of the spaceport.
    - Reporting Back:
       - The player returns to Captain Sofia "Serpent" Vega to share the information gathered from the Spaceport.
       - Depending on the player's choices, they can decide whether to share the Spaceport Survivors' plans with the Galveston Pirates or keep it to themselves.
2. Declining the Proposal:
    - If the player chooses to decline the Pirates' proposal, they are attacked by the Pirates and must fight their way out of Galveston.
3. Informing the Lone Star Republic (after either Accepting or declining the Proposal):
   - The player can choose to inform the Lone Star Republic about the impending raid by talking to government officials in Rice Village.
   - If the player chooses to inform the Lone Star Republic about the impending raid, they are commended for their loyalty and receive information that the Spaceport Survivors are planning a manned space mission.
