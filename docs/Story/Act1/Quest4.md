## Plot
### The Call to Rice Village
- The player, having already established themselves in the Gulf Coast Wasteland through previous quests, receives a message to meet a representative of the Lone Star Republic in Rice Village. Depending on their previous actions, the nature of the message varies:
    - If the player helped the Bayou Brotherhood in Quest 1, Theodore Wilcox, a congressman representing Harbor's Rest (formerly Baytown) greets the player, praising their reputation among the Bayou Brotherhood. A courier delivers the message.
    - If the player helped the Lone Star Republic in Quest 2, the President himself acknowledges the player's heroic efforts at the Spaceport and sends a message. A courier delivers the message. 
    - Both of the above may apply, in which case both the Congressman and the President greet the player.
    - Otherwise, a General of the Texas Rangers broadcasts a message, seeking mercenaries and couriers for a well-paying job. This is a generic message sent to all potential hires.
- The message instructs the player to meet a Lone Star Republic negotiator at Rice Village's town square.
### Rice Village Arrival
- The player arrives at Rice Village, the de facto capital of the Lone Star Republic. Depending on the nature of the message they received, they are greeted differently:
    - If the player helped the Bayou Brotherhood, the congressman representing Harbor's Rest welcomes the player, referring to their prior actions. He introduces the player to the Lone Star Republic negotiator, Sarah Dawson, and their mission.
    - If the player helped the Lone Star Republic, the President personally acknowledges the player's presence and thanks them for their previous assistance. He introduces the player to negotiator Sarah Dawson and explains the importance of the upcoming mission.
    - If the player responded to the general broadcast, they are met by a Lone Star Republic general who provides a brief overview of the mission and introduces Sarah Dawson.
### The Negotiation
- Sarah Dawson explains the mission: to negotiate the purchase of a Fusion Core Stabilizer from the Oil Barons, under the guise of improving electricity stability in the Lone Star Republic's northern settlements.
- The player, accompanied by Sarah, heads to Western Reach, the settlement housing the headquarters of the Oil Barons.
- At Western Reach, they meet with Leonard "Ironclad" Duvall, a high-ranking member of the Oil Barons. Duvall is initially skeptical of the Lone Star Republic's intentions but is willing to negotiate.
- The negotiation takes place, and Duvall presents two offers: selling oil at a discounted rate or providing fusion cores. Sarah must persuade Duvall to sell the Fusion Core Stabilizer.
### Securing the Stabilizer
- The player and Sarah successfully negotiate with Duvall, convincing him of the importance of the Fusion Core Stabilizer for  energy stability in the region. The Oil Barons agree to sell it to the Lone Star Republic.
- The player is entrusted with the Fusion Core Stabilizer, and they, along with Sarah, embark on their journey to deliver it - to the Spaceport. 
- (Without the game-master telling the player), the player must take an indirect route that first goes Northward to not blow their cover. They must avoid the Galveston Pirates, who are still interested in the Spaceport.
    - If the player takes non-initially-northern route, then they are accosted by mercenaries sent by the Oil Barons, including a high-up Oil Barons leader with an angry message from Duvall. The mercenaries attempt to take the Fusion Core Stabilizer by force, unless the player can convince them otherwise.
    - If the player takes a route that is initially south or south-east, then they are accosted by Galveston Pirates, who are still interested in the Spaceport. The Pirates attempt to take the Fusion Core Stabilizer by force, unless the player can convince them otherwise.

### Quest Rewards
- Experience points for completing quest objectives.
- Reputation changes based on the player's choice.
    - If the player successfully delivers the Fusion Core Stabilizer to the Spaceport, then they gain favor with the Lone Star Republic and the Spaceport Survivors.
    - If the player tactfully negotiates a deal with the Oil Barons (i.e. they do not use force or intimidation to obtain the Fusion Core Stabilizer), then they gain favor with the Oil Barons.
- Access to additional faction-related quests for the faction(s) the player supported.

## Purpose
This quest further explores the Lone Star Republic's resource ambitions and introduces the player to the Oil Barons.
