# Prologue Quest: Dawn of Tranquility

## Summary

In the "Dawn of Tranquility" prologue quest, the player character wakes up in a unique and unfamiliar environment: a
pristine, advanced Vault-Tec facility located on the Moon. This serves as a highly secretive lunar mining operation,
operated in partnership with the US government to extract valuable resources. As the player acclimates to the
surroundings and learns about their role as a Vault-Tec security officer, they are thrust into an unexpected conflict.


### Lunar Conspiracy Unveiled

- The player character awakens inside the Vault-Tec lunar facility, greeted by fellow Vault-Tec personnel. They receive a briefing about their role as a security officer and the importance of the lunar mining operation.
- Hints of an imminent lunar sneak attack are subtly introduced through conversations and glimpses of suspicious activities.

    - The player begins in a small, sterile room within the lunar facility. They can hear the muffled voices of other personnel and the distant hum of machinery. This serves as the player's introduction to the setting.
    
    - Have the Vault-Tec personnel interact with the player, providing them with information about their role and the lunar mining operation. Emphasize the importance of this operation to the survival of the United States.

    - As the player explores the facility, they may notice small but unsettling details, such as personnel whispering in hushed tones, unusual activity in restricted areas, and computer terminals left unattended.

    - Encourage the player to engage in conversations with other Vault-Tec personnel to gather more information and establish relationships. Some may drop subtle hints about an impending threat, but without providing specific details.

- A surprise attack occurs, with the Chinese launching a covert assault on the lunar facility. Chaos ensues as the player must navigate the facility's corridors and chambers to protect the Vault-Tec operation.

    - The attack should come as a sudden, unexpected event. The player can experience the impact of the attack through trembling floors, flickering lights, and alarms blaring.

    - Chinese infiltrators should be well-armed and determined. The player is thrust into combat as they attempt to defend the facility. This sequence serves as the action-packed turning point of the quest.

    - Provide the player with a sense of urgency and tension as they must make decisions on the fly, such as choosing routes to protect critical facility areas, helping injured personnel, and responding to enemy threats.

- The attack reveals a concealed conspiracy within the USSA and military, as some of the player's comrades act suspiciously, potentially collaborating with the enemy.

    - During the chaos of the attack, the player may notice certain Vault-Tec personnel acting strangely. They may overhear conversations suggesting betrayal or encounter personnel attempting to sabotage defense systems.

    - The player's fellow security officers should display varying levels of loyalty and betrayal. Some may fight alongside the player, while others may actively hinder their efforts.

- The player must fight off the Chinese intruders while trying to uncover the identity of the conspirators.

    - The player's primary objective is to eliminate the Chinese threat and secure the facility. However, they should also have the option to investigate the conspiracy during combat lulls or by gathering clues from defeated enemies.

    - Encourage the player to piece together the puzzle of the conspiracy by finding documents, accessing computer terminals, or interrogating prisoners. This investigative element adds depth to the quest.

### Confronting the Traitors

- Amid the intense lunar firefight, the player confronts one of the conspirators who is attempting to sabotage the facility's defenses. The conspirator hints at a deeper plan that threatens the stability of the United States.

    - The player should face off against a high-ranking conspirator who has been orchestrating the events. This showdown should take place in a critical facility area, such as the control room.

    - The conspirator should reveal that the lunar facility's operations are part of a larger, more sinister plan that could destabilize the United States. The player should have the opportunity to extract crucial information before neutralizing the threat.

    - The player's confrontation with the conspirator serves as the quest's climax, providing a sense of resolution while leaving the overarching conspiracy intact.

- The Chinese attackers are repelled, but the player character is left with questions about the motives behind the attack and the identity of those involved in the conspiracy.

    - The player's actions should lead to the successful defense of the lunar facility and the defeat of the Chinese attackers. This victory should come at a cost, with some areas of the facility damaged or compromised.

    - The player's unanswered questions about the conspiracy should leave them with a sense of intrigue and the understanding that the threat is not fully extinguished.

- The quest ends with the player witnessing the Vault-Tec facility's damaged systems, as well as the impact of the lunar attack on the facility's vital functions.

    - As the player surveys the aftermath of the attack, they should witness the consequences of the damaged systems, such as life support failures and critical resource shortages.

    - This conclusion sets the stage for the player's journey into the Gulf Coast Wasteland, as they embark on a quest to uncover the larger conspiracy and its implications for the post-apocalyptic world.
