War.... War never changes.....

In the vast annals of human history, it's the one constant, an enduring shadow that looms over every era. From the earliest battlefields of ancient civilizations to the scorched remains of the Great War, the specter of conflict has been a steadfast companion to our kind.

Even among the stars, it seems we can't escape war's relentless grip. The moon, once untouched by human presence, became a new stage for our age-old struggle. As we ventured into the cosmos, we brought with us the oldest of human traits - the capacity for war.

During the Great War, those who were once explorers among the stars and then warriors among them retreated into the safety of Vault 117. Within those hardened walls, they preserved the infrastructure of space and the dreams of peace and connection that once inspired them. It was a solemn mission, and their commitment to this cause never wavered.

But as history has shown, the nature of war leaves its mark wherever humanity has tread. In the Gulf Coast Wasteland, marked by the radioactive fallout of the Great War, it now finds itself on the brink once more. Not a war with guns and bombs, but a war for power, control, and the mysteries of space itself.

Emerging from the vault, the Spaceport Survivors, drawn out by the fear of a new war consuming their world, step into the harsh reality of the Gulf Coast Wasteland, a world teetering on the edge of a new conflict. Here, several factions vie for control, each with its own vision of the future. The Oil Barons, draped in wealth and power, seek to dominate the region with an ever-tightening grip on energy, while the Bayou Brotherhood, guardians of the mystical and natural beauty of the Bayou, aim to protect the lifeblood of the Houston area, preserving its delicate balance. Pirates, both ruthless and cunning, plunder and pillage as they see fit, answering only to their own code. The Lone Star Republic, a beacon of law and order, aims to bring stability to the chaos, even if it means ruling with a firm hand.

In this uncertain world, alliances will be made, tested, and broken, and the destiny of the Gulf Coast Wasteland hangs in the balance. And as the call of the cosmos beckons, an ancient and sinister shadow lurks, a threat long forgotten but never truly vanquished.

In this epic struggle for survival, choices must be made, alliances must be forged, and destinies will be written. The Gulf Coast Wasteland teeters on the edge of a new era, and you will shape its fate.
