War. War never changes.

In the vast annals of human history, it's the one constant, an enduring shadow that looms over every era. From the earliest battlefields of ancient civilizations to the scorched remains of the Great War, the specter of conflict has been a steadfast companion to our kind.

Even among the stars, it seems we can't escape war's relentless grip. The moon, once untouched by human presence, became a new stage for our age-old struggle. As we ventured into the cosmos, we brought with us the oldest of human traits - the capacity for war.

During the Great War, those who were once explorers among the stars and then warriors among them retreated into the safety of Vault 117. Within those hardened walls, they preserved the infrastructure of space and the dreams of peace and connection that once inspired them. It was a solemn mission, and their commitment to this cause never wavered. 

But the nature of war is such that it leaves its mark wherever humanity has tread. The Gulf Coast Wasteland, marked by the radioactive fallout of the Great War, now finds itself on the brink once more. Not a war with guns and bombs, but a war for power, control, and the mysteries of space itself. Now, emerging from the vault, the Spaceport Survivors, drawn out by the fear of a new war consuming their world, step into the harsh reality of the Gulf Coast Wasteland, a world teetering on the edge of a new conflict, with the hope of using the spaceport for the betterment of all.

In this uncertain world, alliances will be made, tested, and broken, and the destiny of the Gulf Coast Wasteland hangs in the balance. And as the call of the cosmos beckons, an ancient and sinister shadow lurks, a threat long forgotten but never truly vanquished.

In this epic struggle for survival, choices must be made, alliances must be forged, and destinies will be written. The Gulf Coast Wasteland teeters on the edge of a new era, and you will shape its fate.
