# Main Quest: Summit's Shadow

*This quest is available after completing (or failing) [Main Quest: Unveiling the Conspiracy](../Act1/Quest6.md).*

## Summary

## Setting

[Scholar's Summit](../../Background/geography/neighborhoods.md#scholars-summit-formerly-huntsville)


## Plot

### Prisoner Arrival

The quest might begin in many ways, depending on the players' previous actions and their status with the Lone Star Republic.

If the players were arrested in [Main Quest: Unveiling the Conspiracy](../Act1/Quest6.md), they are brought to Scholar's Summit Prison along with the other Enclave Prisoners. One or more random encounters *en route* may be appropriate. They are processed and escorted to a holding area. At this point they will be approached by a spy/representative from the Galveston Pirates, the Oil Barons, or possibly the Enclave, who will offer them an escape in exchange for a favor. See the section below for more details on the assignment. The operative will cause a distraction that will allow the players to escape.

If the players are not arrested, but are otherwise in poor or neutral standing with the Lone Star Republic, they are sent to Scholar's Summit to witness the President's address by some official of a faction they are in good standing with. In this scenario, they likely would not be involved in the Pre-addres security briefing.

If the players assisted in the arrests in [Main Quest: Unveiling the Conspiracy](../Act1/Quest6.md), they will help escort the prisoners to Scholar's Summit. One or more random encounters *en route* may be appropriate. They will be involved in processing the prisoners (including meeting [Warden Wiles](lonestarrepublic.md#warden-wiles)) and will be involved in the Pre-Speech Briefing. The President may even invite them to join him on the stand.

### Pre-Speech Briefing

Before the speech, the players are escorted to the Sam Houston Memorial. They are briefed on security protocols and the significance of President Davis's address to the Republic. 

The player is informed about potential threats and the importance of maintaining order during the event. The Texas Rangers have credible intelligence that there will be an attempt at assassinating President Davis, though their intelligence is unclear as to who is perpetrating the attempt or who is backing them. 

The Texas Rangers may also brief them on other potential threats, which may include (the GM should choose as many subplots as appropriate, see below for more details on each subplot):
   - A prison break perpetrated by the Galveston Pirates using the address and the processing of the Enclave prisoners as cover.
   - An attempt by the Oil Barons to disrupt the address and broadcast a message of their own.
   - An attempt by the Enclave to set off a bomb during the address.

#### Plan to Assassinate President Davis

The Texas Rangers' intelligence is that an anti-Lone Star Republic paramilitary group, with unknown backers and motive, are planning to assassinate President Davis during his address. The tip came from an anonymous source, and although the Rangers have been unable the tip, the same source has been reliable in the past. The Rangers are on high alert, and they are taking every precaution to ensure the President's safety.

Because of the short notice (the tip came in only a few hours before the address, and only an hour after the arrests), the Rangers have not been able to deeply investigate this paramilitary group, but several of its members are known to be ex-Ranger soldiers living in the forest near Scholar's Summit. The Rangers have been unable to locate the group's base of operations, and they are asking for the players' help in finding and stopping the group before they can carry out their plan.

All attendees are required to pass through a security checkpoint, including turning over all weapons.

There are three members of this group involved in this scheme.

   - **The Fool**: The fool is a former Ranger private who is unwittingly being used as a patsy. He has a bomb that he is attempting to bring into the venue, but is apprehended by the Rangers at the security checkpoint. Unbeknownst to him, the bomb is a dud, and the other two members of the group are simply using him to cause a distraction and to draw attention away from the others.
   - **The Infiltrator**: The infiltrator is a former Ranger sergeant who manages to sneak into the venue with a concealed pipe gun, seated on the third row from the stand. If the sniper does not succeed, the infiltrator will attempt to shoot the President in close range.
   - **The Sniper**: The sniper is a former Ranger sniper who has been living in the forest for several years. He is a crack shot, and he has been tasked with assassinating the President from a distance. He is armed with a high-powered rifle and is hiding in a dilapidated highway sign 200 meters north of the Sam Houston Statue.

### Faction Agents Approach
 
While players are waiting for the address to start (either immediately after the security briefing or while waiting for the audience to assemble), agents from the Galveston Pirates, Oil Barons, and possibly the Enclave approach the player with covert proposals.

!!! note
   Since Act II is significantly more non-linear than Act I, the GM should use discretion in choosing which (if any) subplots to include in this quest. The GM should also consider the players' previous actions and their standing with the factions when deciding which subplots to include. An important part of this quest is providing players with the opportunity to "reset" any negative reputation they may have with the factions because of their actions in Act I. Most playthroughs will not include all of these ideas, and some may include others not listed here. All the important information that players would receive during these subplots will be available later in each faction's respective quest lines. 


#### Galveston Pirates Prison Break

Several months prior, Captain Blackbeard and his crew were captured by the Ranger Coast Guard after they [sank the *Costa Concorida*](../../Background/background.md#sinking-of-the-costa-concordia) and killed its crew. 

The Pirate operative, wearing an eye-patch, will first (if necessary) offer complete amnesty for any and all transgressions against the Pirates. He explains that the Galveston Pirates have been planning a jailbreak for Blackbeard and his crew from the High-security prison for some time, and they have been waiting for the right moment. Upon finding out that the President would be addressing the Republic at the same time and in the same settlement as the processing of the Enclave prisoners, they have decided that this is the right moment. 

The agent will ask the players to cause a diversion at the address and/or the Enclave prisoner processing area to allow undercover Pirate operatives within the Ranger to break out Captain Blackbeard and his crew. The operative will offer the players a chance to escape with them, and they will be given a rendezvous point and time. The operative will also offer the players a reward for their assistance, and will offer to help them escape if they are arrested.

The players must decide on the nature of the diversion. Options could include setting off an explosion, starting a fire, or instigating a fight among the crowd.

Allow the players to use their skills and resources to creatively plan and execute the diversion. This could involve stealth checks to plant an explosive device, a charisma or strength check to incite a riot, or a science check to disrupt the venue's power supply.

Once the diversion is initiated, chaos ensues. The Rangers and security forces are distracted, and the Pirate operatives make their move. Describe the ensuing pandemonium, with civilians fleeing, security trying to maintain order, and the distant sounds of a skirmish breaking out near the prisoner holding area. Many Rangers who are at the speech will leave to help with the prison break, unless they are needed to maintain order at the speech.

The rendezvous point is a small unassuming building in the Sam Houston National Forest some distance from the prison. If the players successfully reach the rendezvous point without being captured, they are greeted by Captain Blackbeard himself, who thanks them for their bravery and assures them that their reward awaits. The players are given the option to join the Pirates on their next venture or to take their reward and part ways.

If the players are captured, then some of the Pirates who are undercover prison guards will help them escape.


#### Oil Barons Disruption

An Oil baron operative will approach the players, granting them full amnesty with the Oil Barons (if necessary), then offer them a large sum of money and/or resources to disrupt the address by hijacking the broadcast and instead broadcasting a message from the Oil Barons. If the players accept, the operative will give them a holotape with a message to broadcast and point them to the radio antenna set up down a path into the forest just past the Sam Houston Memorial. 

When players choose to listen to the holotape, read or paraphrase the following message:

> **Oil Barons' Hijacked Broadcast Message**
> 
> Introductory Statement: "Citizens of the Lone Star Republic, we urge you to listen closely. The government you trust, led by President Samuel Davis, is not what it seems. There are truths that have been kept from you—truths that you deserve to know. What follows is a conversation from the heart of your leadership, a conversation that reveals the true nature of the so-called 'peace' you've been sold."
> 
> Leaked Conversation: [Sound of a bugged recording playing]
> 
> Wilcox: "Sam, you can't just sit on this. The evidence against the Barons is tentative, sure, but it's enough to act on. It's an election year. If it turns out the Spaceport had a shadowy conspiracy calling the shots, and you did nothing, you'll be obliterated at the polls."
> 
> Davis: "I won't declare war on a hunch, Theodore. We need solid proof before we make a move that drastic."
> 
> Wilcox: "Proof? You need public support. And nothing rallies the Republic like a common foe. Think about it—the hero President, taking a stand against the Barons' crimes. It's not just about the election; it's about uniting the Republic when it needs it most."
> 
> Davis: "The Barons have been causing energy shortages, and the Rangers could easily defeat them. But I cannot be seen as weak, not now. Even if the Barons are not directly involved with the Enclave conspiracy, their actions are destabilizing the wasteland. We need to act, to show that the Republic won't stand for this, that we're in control."
> 
> [Recording ends]
> 
> Closing Statement: "There you have it, fellow citizens. A war, proposed not for justice, but for votes. Not for the Republic, but for one man's political gain. Ask yourselves—is this the leadership we want? Is this the Republic we believe in? The Oil Barons stand for truth and transparency. It's time for a change. It's time for the truth."

The Radio tower is down a path into the woods, only about 500 feet away from the Sam Houston Memorial. There are wires from the microphones at the podium on the stand leading to the tower. Although the top of the tower is visible over the trees, the base is hidden from view from the audience area. 

When players arrive at the tower, they will find one Texas Ranger standing guard outside a small shack at the base of the tower. The Ranger will be armed and will be on high alert, but he will not be expecting an attack. With a high enough skill check or a good enough plan, the players can convince the Ranger to either leave his post or let them in. Once inside, they will find two unarmed radio operators who are so focused on preparing for the broadcast they will not notice the players upon entry. Players will have to either convince the operators to help or to leave (or to incapacitate them). Once the players have control of the radio, they can set their holotape to play and broadcast, either immediately or at a later time. If the radio operators are taken out, the players will have to figure out how to operate the radio themselves.

#### Enclave Bombing

An Enclave operative (from the Oil Baron Enclave) will approach the players, granting them full amnesty with the Enclave (if necessary) and offer them to help with a clandestine operation to set off a bomb during the address. The operative will give the players a small, powerful bomb and a detonator. The operative will also give the players a radio to listen to the address from a safe distance. The players are offered significant compensation for their assistance, as well as the promise of future support from the Enclave's extensive network. The Enclave cares more about sending a message that they are still a force to be reckoned with than they do about actually killing the President or civilians.

The players must decide on how and where they will discreetly plant the bomb.  

### President Davis's Address

![Map of the Sam Houston Statue](../../Assets/maps/PresidentAddressMap.png)

The stage is set up at the foot of the Sam Houston Statue, with a podium equipped with many microphones. The audience area is a large open space with approximately 15 rows of chairs in front of the stage. The area is roped off, and there are several Texas Rangers patrolling the area as security. Behind the last row of chairs is an elevated press platform, where several reporters are setting up their equipment. The area is off the side of the Interstate-45, which is open and clear. Many trees and bushes surround the Statue and audience area (on all sides except the highway). Two small, well-maintained paths lead into the woods on either side of the statue, the southern one of which leads to the radio tower, and the northern one leads to a visitor's center and a small parking lot.

On the stage behind the podium are several high-ranking members of the Lone Star Republic, including Vice-president Isabella Torres, Congressman Theodore Wilcox, a few other members of the Senate and Congress, several high-ranking Texas Rangers, as well as [Sarah Dawson](../../denizens_of_the_wasteland/factions/major/lonestarrepublic.md#sarah-dawson) and [Dr. Emily Wells](../../denizens_of_the_wasteland/factions/major/oilbarons.md#dr-emily-wells). If the players are in good standing with President Davis, they will be invited to join the President on the stand.

Read or paraphrase the following speech to the players. Feel free to _ad lib_ and add details relevant to the players' previous actions; President Davis is well known for his deviating from his prepared remarks. Additionally, feel free to interrupt your narration to inform the players of actions in the world that are happening in real time, or to ask the players to respond to the speech as it is being delivered.

> **President Davis's Address to the Lone Star Republic**
> 
> My fellow citizens of the Lone Star Republic,
> 
> Today, we stand united at the foot of the great Samuel Houston who championed freedom and security, principles that our great Republic was founded upon. As your President, it is my solemn duty to safeguard our nation and ensure the prosperity of every man, woman, and child within our borders.
> 
> Recent events have brought to light a grave threat lurking in the shadows. We have uncovered and arrested several Enclave officials who conspired against our Republic. Their treachery, tied to the machinations of the Oil Barons, sought to undermine the very core of our society. Let this be a message to all who wish to do us harm: the Lone Star Republic will not falter, we will not bend, and we will bring justice to our enemies.
> 
> In response to these threats, I am announcing a comprehensive initiative to increase the defenses of all our settlements. The Spaceport, a beacon of hope and human achievement, will receive special attention as we fortify it against any possible attack. We will not allow the ambitions of the Oil Barons or the piracy of the Galveston Pirates to jeopardize our future.
> 
> As we reinforce our home, let us also remember the values that bind us. The Lone Star Republic was built on the ideals of cooperation, hard work, and the indomitable spirit of our people. It is together, as a united front, that we will face the challenges ahead.
> 
> And so, as we look toward the horizon, let us march forward with determination. I am proud to announce my campaign for reelection, with a promise to continue leading our Republic to new heights of glory and security.
> 
> God bless you all, and God bless the Lone Star Republic!

All the subplots (if any) will unravel during the speech. 

Additionally, the plot to assassinate President Samuel will come to head, unless interrupted because of the players' actions. The fool will be apprehended at the security checkpoint shortly before the speech begins. The sniper, unless interrupted, will take a shot halfway through the speech. If the President is still alive by the end of the speech, the infiltrator will attempt to shoot the President in close range.

!!! warning 
   Note that President Davis is wearing both a suit and a wig with ballistic weave. This greatly improves his physical damage resistance (+6 Phys. DR), and will likely survive the sniper's shot, the infiltrator's shot, and any other physical attacks. The fact that he is wearing a wig is not public knowledge (it is made from his own hair), so the fact that he survives a shot to the head should be a surprise to everyone, including the players. Past playthroughs have had success by simply refusing to tell the players the difficulty of an attack to the head (if the players attempt to attack the President).

### Aftermath of the Address

If the President is shot, then he will be rushed by the Texas Rangers to the hospital at [Scholar's Summit](../../Background/geography/neighborhoods.md#scholars-summit-formerly-huntsville). In most cases, the President should survive the attack (thanks to his ballistic weave), but he will likely be in critical condition. If the players did not betray the Lone Star Republic in any of the subplots, then they will be asked to help with the investigation. If one of the players has high medical skills, then they can help treat the President at the scene.

If the players were involved in any of the subplots (or help undermine those subplots), then they will be approached by the faction they helped/undermined and offered a reward for their assistance or a threat for their betrayal.
