# Main Quest: Summit's Shadow

*This quest is available after completing (or failing) [Main Quest: Unveiling the Conspiracy](../Act1/Quest6.md).*

## Summary

## Setting

[Scholar's Summit](../../Background/geography/neighborhoods.md#scholars-summit-formerly-huntsville)


## Plot

2. **Pre-Speech Briefing**:
   - Before the speech, the player is briefed on security protocols and the significance of President Davis's address to the Republic.
   - The player is informed about potential threats and the importance of maintaining order during the event.
   
3. **Faction Agents Approach**:
   - While the prisoners are being processed, agents from the Galveston Pirates, Oil Barons, and possibly the Enclave approach the player with covert proposals.
   - Each agent presents a different task that could undermine the Republic or further their own faction's agenda.
   
4. **President Davis's Address**:
   - President Davis delivers his speech, announcing the arrests of Enclave officials, their connections to the Oil Barons, and the initiative to increase defenses.
   - The player must remain vigilant, as the speech could be a prime moment for an assassination attempt or other disruptive actions.
   
5. **Decision Point**:
   - The player must decide whether to carry out any of the tasks proposed by the faction agents, remain loyal to the Republic, or find a way to foil the agents' plans.
   - The player's actions during the speech will have immediate and long-term consequences for their relationship with the factions and the Republic.
   
6. **Quest Resolution**:
   - The quest concludes with the outcome of the player's decisions. This could range from successfully protecting the President and the event to dealing with the fallout of a disrupted speech or a failed security protocol.
   - The player's actions are debriefed by Republic officials, and the stage is set for future quests based on the new political landscape.


### Prisoner Arrival

The quest might begin in many ways, depending on the players' previous actions and their status with the Lone Star Republic.

If the players were arrested in [Main Quest: Unveiling the Conspiracy](../Act1/Quest6.md), they are brought to Scholar's Summit Prison along with the other Enclave Prisoners. One or more random encounters *en route* may be appropriate. They are processed and escorted to a holding area. At this point they will be approached by a spy/representative from the Galveston Pirates, the Oil Barons, or possibly the Enclave, who will offer them an escape in exchange for a favor. See the section below for more details on the assignment. The operative will cause a distraction that will allow the players to escape.

If the players are not arrested, but are otherwise in poor or neutral standing with the Lone Star Republic, they are sent to Scholar's Summit to witness the President's address by some official of a faction they are in good standing with. In this scenario, they likely would not be involved in the Pre-addres security briefing.

If the players assisted in the arrests in [Main Quest: Unveiling the Conspiracy](../Act1/Quest6.md), they will help escort the prisoners to Scholar's Summit. One or more random encounters *en route* may be appropriate. They will be involved in processing the prisoners (including meeting [Warden Wiles](lonestarrepublic.md#warden-wiles)) and will be involved in the Pre-Speech Briefing.

### Pre-Speech Briefing

Before the speech, the player is briefed on security protocols and the significance of President Davis's address to the Republic. 

The player is informed about potential threats and the importance of maintaining order during the event. The Texas Rangers have credible intelligence that there will be an attempt at assassinating President Davis, though their intelligence is unclear as to who is perpetrating the attempt or who is backing them. 

The Texas Rangers may also brief them on other potential threats, which may include (the GM should choose as many subplots as appropriate, see below for more details on each subplot):
   - A prison break perpetrated by the Galveston Pirates using the address and the processing of the Enclave prisoners as cover.
   - An attempt by the Oil Barons to disrupt the address and broadcast a message of their own.
   - An attempt by the Enclave to set off a bomb during the address.


### Faction Agents Approach

While players are waiting for the address to start (either immediately after the security briefing or while waiting for the audience to assemble), agents from the Galveston Pirates, Oil Barons, and possibly the Enclave approach the player with covert proposals.

#### Galveston Pirates Prison Break

- Several months prior, Captain Blackbeard and his crew were captured by the Ranger Coast Guard after they sank the *Costa Concorida* and killed its crew.

### President Davis's Address

Read or paraphrase the following speech to the players. Feel free to _ad lib_ and add details relevant to the players' previous actions; President Davis is well known for his deviating from his prepared remarks. Additionally, feel free to interrupt your narration to inform the players of actions in the world that are happening in real time, or to ask the players to respond to the speech as it is being delivered.

> **President Davis's Address to the Lone Star Republic**
> 
> My fellow citizens of the Lone Star Republic,
> 
> Today, we stand united at the foot of the great Samuel Houston who championed freedom and security, principles that our great Republic was founded upon. As your President, it is my solemn duty to safeguard our nation and ensure the prosperity of every man, woman, and child within our borders.
> 
> Recent events have brought to light a grave threat lurking in the shadows. We have uncovered and arrested several Enclave officials who conspired against our Republic. Their treachery, tied to the machinations of the Oil Barons, sought to undermine the very core of our society. Let this be a message to all who wish to do us harm: the Lone Star Republic will not falter, we will not bend, and we will bring justice to our enemies.
> 
> In response to these threats, I am announcing a comprehensive initiative to increase the defenses of all our settlements. The Spaceport, a beacon of hope and human achievement, will receive special attention as we fortify it against any possible attack. We will not allow the ambitions of the Oil Barons or the piracy of the Galveston Pirates to jeopardize our future.
> 
> As we reinforce our home, let us also remember the values that bind us. The Lone Star Republic was built on the ideals of cooperation, hard work, and the indomitable spirit of our people. It is together, as a united front, that we will face the challenges ahead.
> 
> And so, as we look toward the horizon, let us march forward with determination. I am proud to announce my campaign for reelection, with a promise to continue leading our Republic to new heights of glory and security.
> 
> God bless you all, and God bless the Lone Star Republic!
