## The Spaceport Survivors

- **Overview:** The Spaceport Survivors are descendants of USSA astronauts, scientists, and military personnel who
  survived in a hidden vault beneath the Johnson Space Center.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Secret Vault: They operate from Vault 117, a hidden mission control center beneath the Johnson Space Center,
      preserving the legacy of space exploration.
    - Space Ambitions: The Spaceport Survivors are preparing for a historic manned rocket launch, the first of its kind
      since the Great War, as they aim to continue humanity's space exploration legacy.
- **Notable Figures:**
    - Director Catherine "Starborn" Caldwell: The visionary leader of the Spaceport Survivors, driven by the mission to
      revive space exploration.
    - Agent Victor "Stardust" Caldwell: A mysterious figure with ties to the Enclave, who is involved in secret
      machinations.
- **Conflict:** The Spaceport Survivors are focused on their mission, but they are not immune to the intrigues and
  hidden agendas within the wasteland, particularly from the Enclave.
- **Goals for Spaceport**:
    - Equipped with resources from their recent alliance with the Lone Star Republic, the Spaceport Survivors are
      preparing for a historic manned rocket launch. This launch represents the culmination of their efforts to revive
      space exploration and continue humanity's legacy in the post-apocalyptic world. Their goals for the spaceport are
      multi-faceted:
        - Symbol of Progress: The Spaceport Survivors see the spaceport as a symbol of progress and hope, showcasing
          humanity's ability to overcome the challenges of the post-apocalyptic world and achieve great feats.
        - Space Exploration: The spaceport represents an opportunity to continue humanity's legacy of space exploration,
          potentially finding new resources or safe havens beyond the wasteland.
        - Repairing existing satellites: The Spaceport Survivors aim to repair existing satellites, in an attempt to
          improve communication across the world.
    - The hidden Enclave cell within the Spaceport Survivors wish to hijack the mission (by way of placing crew members
      from within their own ranks) so to retake
      the [Ballistic Orbital Missile Base 001](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ballistic_Orbital_Missile_Base_001).
      Capturing this station would give this Enclave cell the ability to launch nuclear missiles at any target on the
      planet. This would be a major threat to any an all of the Enclave's enemies.

## The Galveston Pirates

- **Overview:** The Galveston Pirates are a formidable force controlling key ports along the Gulf Coast. They are known
  for their ruthless tactics and control over sea routes.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Port Control: They effectively control trade routes and access to valuable resources through their control of
      Galveston's ports.
    - Pirate Raids: The Galveston Pirates regularly raid ships and coastal settlements, accumulating wealth and
      resources by force.
- **Notable Figures:**
    - Captain Sofia "Serpent" Vega: A respected pirate captain who commands several pirate crews and negotiates with the
      Cartel.
    - Rafael "El Diablo" SÃ¡nchez: The ruthless leader of the Cartel, who has a significant influence over the pirates.
- **Conflict:** The Galveston Pirates have an ongoing conflict with the Lone Star Republic, primarily over resource
  access. This rivalry fuels much of the region's instability.
- **Goals for Spaceport**:
    - The Galveston Pirates see the spaceport as a potential source of valuable resources, including advanced technology
      and materials. They aim to secure these resources by any means necessary, including raiding the spaceport or
      sabotaging the Lone Star Republic's efforts.
    - The Galveston Pirates also see the spaceport as a potential threat to their control over the region's ports and
      trade routes. They aim to prevent the Lone Star Republic from launching a manned rocket, which could give them a
      significant advantage in the wasteland. This could include sabotaging the launch or capturing the spaceport for
      themselves.
    - Although they are perfectly fine with the destruction of the spaceport, they would prefer to capture it for
      themselves. This would give them a significant advantage over the Lone Star Republic and the Spaceport Survivors.
      They would be able to use the spaceport to launch their own rockets, giving them the ability to exert control and
      intimidation over the wasteland and expand their influence. Additionally, they could use the spaceport's resources
      to improve their technology and weaponry, making them a formidable force in the region.

## The Bayou Brotherhood

      and traditions.
- **Notable Figures:**
    - Cyrus "Gator" Boudreaux: The charismatic leader of the Bayou Brotherhood, who welcomes the player character and
      offers guidance.
    - Ezekiel "Swamp Sage" Thibodeaux: A mystic within the Bayou Brotherhood who holds insights into the connection
      between the Bayou and the cosmos.
- **Conflict:** The Bayou Brotherhood is protective of their territory, but they are drawn into the larger conflicts of
  the wasteland due to their unique perspective and resources.
- **Goals for Spaceport**:
    - The Bayou Brotherhood is largely apathetic to the existence of the spaceport and of the upcoming rocket launch for
      any practical reasons. Symbolically, however, they see the spaceport as an opportunity for humanity to reconnect
      with the cosmos and rediscover their place in the universe.

## The Oil and Energy Barons

- **Overview:** The Oil and Energy Barons are an economic conglomerate with control over various power sources,
  including oil and nuclear energy. They may have ties to pre-war corporations.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Economic Power: They exert significant influence over the wasteland's economy and control the production and
      distribution of essential resources.
    - Mysterious Origins: Their connections to pre-war companies, such as Poseidon Energy, suggest a hidden history and
      potentially nefarious intentions.

    - Leonard "Ironclad" Duvall: A high-ranking member of the Oil and Energy Barons, responsible for resource management
      and trade negotiations. Ghoul who prior to the Great War was a high-ranking executive at Poseidon Energy.
    - Dr. Emily "Fusion" Wells: A scientist rumored to be working on advanced energy technologies within their ranks.
- **Conflict:** The Oil and Energy Barons' monopoly over power sources has contributed to the energy crisis, leading to
  tension with other factions and the Lone Star Republic's aggressive actions.
- **Goals for Spaceport**:
    - The Oil and Energy Barons see the spaceport as a potential source of advanced technology and materials, which
      could be used to improve their energy production capabilities. They aim to secure these resources by any means
      necessary, including raiding the spaceport or sabotaging the Lone Star Republic's efforts.
    - They oppose any further rocket launches, and they aim to prevent the Lone Star Republic from launching a manned
      rocket. This could include sabotaging the launch or capturing the spaceport for themselves.
    - One group, led by Leonard Duvall himself, believe that going into space before the Great War was a mistake, as the
      space race is what led to the resource wars and the Great War itself.
    - Others among the Oil Barons oppose it for less ideological reasons, merely because they see it as a threat to
      their fragile dominance over the region's energy resources.
    - Enclave agents among the Oil and Energy Barons, having re-established contact with the Enclave cell within the
      Spaceport Survivors, are providing external influence to help the Enclave cell hijack the mission. They hope to
      use the captured orbital station not only to further the Enclave's goals, but also to personally gain control over
      the Oil and Energy Barons themselves by threatening to use the station's nuclear missiles against off-shore oil
      rigs and other key energy infrastructure.
