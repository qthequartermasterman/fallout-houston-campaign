# The Bayou Brotherhood

## Overview
- **Overview:** The Bayou Brotherhood consists of Cajun swamp-dwellers who have deep spiritual ties to the Bayou and
  seek to preserve their way of life.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Spiritual Connection: The Bayou Brotherhood believes that the Bayou holds mystical and cosmic significance,
      providing them with a unique perspective on the world.
    - Isolationist: They are cautious about interactions with outsiders and prioritize the preservation of their culture
      and traditions.
- **Notable Figures:**
    - Cyrus "Gator" Boudreaux: The charismatic leader of the Bayou Brotherhood, who welcomes the player character and
      offers guidance.
    - Ezekiel "Swamp Sage" Thibodeaux: A mystic within the Bayou Brotherhood who holds insights into the connection
      between the Bayou and the cosmos.
- **Conflict:** The Bayou Brotherhood is protective of their territory, but they are drawn into the larger conflicts of
  the wasteland due to their unique perspective and resources.
- **Goals for Spaceport**:
    - The Bayou Brotherhood is largely apathetic to the existence of the spaceport and of the upcoming rocket launch for
      any practical reasons. Symbolically, however, they see the spaceport as an opportunity for humanity to reconnect
      with the cosmos and rediscover their place in the universe.

## History
### Origins
The early members of the Bayou Brotherhood are descendants of Cajun swamp-dwellers who survived the Great War. A rocket crash lands into the Bayou, and its crew is rescued by the swamp-dwellers. Those aboard the rocket tell the story of a Moon Spirit that had intervened during an attack on their space station, saving their lives. The swamp-dwellers, who had long believed in the mystical power of the Bayou, saw this as a sign that the Moon Spirit had chosen them to be its guardians. The Moon Spirit is actually the player character interacting with the past. See [The Overseer's Surrender](dawn_of_tranquility.md#the-overseers-surrender) for more details.
