# Enclave

**Main article: [Enclave (from the Fallout Wiki)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Enclave)**

The Enclave is a secretive political, scientific, and militaristic organization that is descended directly from members
of the pre-War United States government, and claims to be the legally-sanctioned continuation of the government of the
United States. After major defeats on the West Coast and in the Capital Wasteland (in Fallout 2 and 3, respectively),
the Enclave has been reduced to a shadow of its former self. Splinter groups and remnants of the Enclave continue to
exist, however, and some still seek to restore the Enclave to its former glory. There are two such groups in the Gulf
Coast Wasteland: The Spaceport Enclave and the Oil Baron Enclave. Both of these groups do not consider themselves to be
splinter groups, but rather secret cells put in place for some future purpose. Their members are also members of their 
other corresponding organization, tasked with leading those groups to secretly fulfill Enclave goals. They have been 
aware of each other since long before [emergence of the Spaceport Survivors](spaceportsurvivors.md), this is
significant, as the Spaceport Survivors _writ large_ are otherwise completely isolated from the ouside world.
