# Enclave

**Main article: [Enclave (from the Fallout Wiki)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Enclave)**

## Overview

The Enclave is a secretive political, scientific, and militaristic organization that is descended directly from members
of the pre-War United States government, and claims to be the legally-sanctioned continuation of the government of the
United States. The Enclave believes in restoring a “pure” human race and government, devoid of mutation or wasteland
influence. After major defeats on the West Coast and in the Capital Wasteland (in Fallout 2 and 3, respectively),
the Enclave has been reduced to a shadow of its former self. Splinter groups and remnants of the Enclave continue to
exist, however, and some still seek to restore the Enclave to its former glory.

### Key Characteristics

- **Deep Secrecy**: The Gulf Coast Enclave functions almost entirely in the shadows, with no faction fully aware of their activities. The Enclave maintains operatives within the Lone Star Republic, the Oil Barons, the Galveston Pirates, and the Spaceport Survivors. They operate using a cell structure, and many members are unaware of each other’s true identities or overall goals.
- **High Command and Strict Hierarchy**: The Enclave leadership functions with a council known only by Greek letter designations. This council operates under Alpha’s absolute authority, and most members communicate only through coded messages, remote viewing, or at rare council gatherings.
- **Visionary Technology Ambitions**: The Enclave sees technology as both a means of control and a necessity for their vision of a “pure” America. Their plans center around activating the **BOMB-001** orbital station, an orbital weapons platform capable of launching nuclear missiles, which they believe will purge the surface of mutations in preparation for the return of Enclave-approved generation ships.

### Notable Figures

- **Alpha**: The charismatic and ruthless leader of the Gulf Coast Enclave, who possesses telekinetic powers due to a unique artifact he discovered years ago. Known for his careful planning, intimidating presence, and skill in using his powers to enforce loyalty.
- **Beta (Theodore Wilcox)**: Congressman of the Lone Star Republic, representing Harbor’s Rest and pushing the Expansionist Party agenda. He subtly influences decisions, using his position to manipulate the Republic toward Enclave interests.
- **Epsilon (Thomas Phillips)**: An influential member of the Oil Barons, covertly planning a coup against Leonard Petrovich to seize control of the Securitron army for the Enclave.
- **Sigma (Charles Haliburton)**: Deputy overseer of the Spaceport Vault and direct Enclave agent who oversees the Survivors’ rocket project, ensuring Enclave control over its mission and launch.

## History

### Pre-War Origins and Project Stargaze

The Enclave has roots tracing back to pre-War intelligence and military structures, united by a shared belief in the
survival of “pure” humans, with a government run by elites deemed genetically and ideologically fit.

**Project Stargaze** was one of the Enclave’s pre-war research projects, centered on lunar artifacts with mysterious
remote-viewing abilities discovered at a Vault-Tec mining base on the moon. These artifacts included stone charms and
statues, later theorized to be ancient Zetan artifacts, that allowed certain users to experience visions through time
and space. Enclave scientists believed these artifacts could serve as advanced espionage tools or even weapons for
psychological warfare, but with resource shortages and failed experiments, the project was shelved.

During the Great War, most of these artifacts were lost on the moon during the Battle of the Sea of Tranquility.
However, a few charms and a large “stone head” statue were salvaged and secretly kept within Enclave facilities on
Earth.

### Feud with Vault-Tec

!!! warning
This section, while not contradicting any canon, is not canon itself. It is a fan theory that this campaign builds upon.

Vault-Tec was a pre-war corporation contracted by the United States Government to construct and operate many Vaults as
part of Project Safehouse. The Enclave, a shadow organization within the United States Government, conspired with
Vault-Tec to use the Vaults to conduct experiments on the American population, to see how they would react to various
conditions, in an effort to gather data in preparation for colonizing another planet. The Enclave's goal was to ensure
that only the "purest" humans would be allowed to leave Earth, and the Vaults were a way to test the population and
determine who was worthy of leaving.

While high-ranking members of Vault-Tec were aware of the Enclave, and indeed conspired with them, those same corporate
leaders believed that Vault-Tec would be able to use the Vaults to sieze power and exert influence over the post-war
world, independent of existing governments and organizations, including the Enclave. Many believe that Vault-Tec
themselves started the Great War, in order to execute their plans. And indeed, their actions after the bombs fell, such
as attempts
to [seize control of Nuclear Silos in Appalachia](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_76_overseer#post-war), confirm
that they had plans to exert control over the post-war world.

Even many years before the bombs fell, the Enclave grew suspicious of Vault-Tec's impending betrayal, and began to plan
for a way to stop them. Indeed, it was the Enclave who prompted the
lunar [Chinese Attack on the Vault-Tec Tranquility Mining Operation](dawn_of_tranquility.md). They also worked to
sabotage certain Vaults that the Enclave deemd "unnecessary" to their plans, and planted hidden Enclave cells within
other, more important Vaults, such as [Vault 117](spaceportsurvivors.md).

### Ballistic Orbital Missile Base 001

**Main
article: [Ballistic Orbital Missile Base 001 (from the Fallout Wiki)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ballistic_Orbital_Missile_Base_001)
**
The BOMB-001 was a pre-war orbital weapons platform designed to launch nuclear missiles at any target on Earth. It was
also in the process of being retrofitted with a giant orbital laser at the time of the Great War, to be able to destroy
nuclear missiles in transit. It was an operation of the United States Military, but secretly run by the pre-war Enclave.
Unfortunately, contact was lost with the station shortly after the Great War. The Enclave has long sought to regain
control of this platform, believing it to be the key to their vision of a “pure” world.

### Reemergence in the Gulf Coast

Following the major defeats of the West Coast Enclave (Fallout 2) and East Coast Enclave (Fallout 3), Enclave remnants
reorganized into regional splinter cells. The Gulf Coast Enclave, under **Alpha’s** leadership, established itself as a
powerful underground force, embedded in various Gulf Coast factions.

In the last 20 years, the Gulf Coast Enclave, leveraging Alpha’s artifact-enhanced telekinetic powers and ruthless
discipline, systematically inserted agents into every major faction in the region. These agents have risen to positions
of influence, enabling the Enclave to manipulate resources and policies for its ends.

### Involvement in the Spaceport’s Reveal

The Enclave’s interest in space exploration remained high due to their goal of gaining access to BOMB-001. Aware of Vault 117’s continued survival beneath the Johnson Space Center, the Enclave carefully monitored the Spaceport’s activities for generations, positioning select operatives within the Lone Star Republic and other factions to ensure that, when the time came, they would be able to access the Spaceport and its resources.

Alpha devised a plan to orchestrate the Spaceport’s reveal, beginning by directing select agents to sabotage the Spaceport’s communication protocols, drawing unwanted attention. When the Spaceport was exposed, the Enclave’s agents subtly encouraged regional factions to take an interest in the Spaceport’s technology, setting the stage for future conflict.

### Operation Costa Concordia and the Discovery of the Moon Artifacts

When a group of Lone Star Republic Rangers unexpectedly unearthed a cache of lunar artifacts, including a large “stone head” and numerous charms during an exploratory mission, they initially reported their findings as scientific relics. However, Alpha, recognizing the potential connection to Project Stargaze, ordered Enclave operatives on the Costa Concordia to recover these items covertly. 

Under the guise of transporting rare artifacts for Lone Star Republic archives, Enclave agents secured the head and charms and began limited testing on the head’s remote-viewing capabilities. These artifacts, believed to be of ancient Zetan origin, rekindled Alpha’s vision for the Gulf Coast Enclave’s rise. The Enclave soon integrated these artifacts into their plans, with Alpha personally leading experiments to master the remote viewing powers of the head.

Now, with the artifacts in their possession, the Enclave saw a new opportunity: using the head to influence events in the Gulf Coast region remotely, enabling surveillance and even possible control over rivals. The Enclave Council began to hold covert meetings where they could communicate remotely through the head, extending Alpha’s influence and vision.


## Structure and Goals

### Enclave Goals and Phases of Operation

1. **Phase 1: Placing Agents in Key Positions** (Mostly complete by the beginning of the campaign, to be completed as part of Acts I and II)
   Over the past 20 years, the Enclave strategically placed agents across the Lone Star Republic, Oil Barons, Galveston
   Pirates, and Spaceport Survivors. Each agent has a specific role, from resource manipulation to political influence.

2. **Phase 2: Reveal the Spaceport** (Complete by the beginning of the campaign)
   The Enclave orchestrated events that led to the Spaceport’s rediscovery, ensuring that it would become a regional
   focal point for technological advancements.

3. **Phase 3: Using the Lone Star Republic to Scavenge Kennedy Space Center** (Complete by the beginning of the campaign)
   By influencing the Republic to explore the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the Enclave acquired the components and
   knowledge necessary for a manned rocket launch, vital for their final mission.

4. **Phase 4: Constructing the Rocket and Experimenting with Artifacts** (In progress at beginning of the campaign, part of Acts I and II)
   In tandem, Enclave agents oversee rocket construction at the Spaceport and conduct covert experiments with the moon
   artifacts. Alpha has taken a particular interest in harnessing the stone head and charms to enhance remote viewing
   capabilities, which they use in council meetings and intelligence operations.

5. **Phase 5: Initiating Controlled War Between Factions** (Not yet started at the beginning of the campaign, kicks off in Act II)
   With the game’s start, the Enclave will subtly escalate tensions among factions. By carefully stoking conflicts, they
   keep factions preoccupied, minimizing scrutiny of the Enclave’s rocket project.

6. **Phase 6: Hijacking the Rocket and Gaining Control of BOMB-001** (Not yet started at the beginning of the campaign, planned for Act III)
   Enclave agents will commandeer the rocket launch, taking a select crew to the **BOMB-001** orbital station. Their
   goal is to re-establish control over its nuclear arsenal, ensuring the Enclave can enforce their vision globally.

7. **Phase 7: Purging the Earth and Preparing for a "Pure" New World** (Not yet started at the beginning of the campaign)
   With control of the orbital platform, Alpha will execute his plan to cleanse the Earth of all mutations, preparing it
   for the return of generation ships bearing “pure” humans, whom the Enclave will mold to recreate a pre-War United
   States.


### Enclave Council and Key Operatives

The Gulf Coast Enclave operates with a council structure where each member is known by a Greek letter designation. The
council follows a strict chain of command, with only **Alpha** and a few inner members privy to the full extent of
Enclave plans.

Here’s an updated Enclave Council with additional members embedded in roles as regional traders and local leaders,
giving them influence over resources, transportation, and local communities. These roles allow the Enclave to more
subtly sway public opinion, control local economies, and manage regional relationships.

#### Alpha

**Title**: Supreme Leader of the Gulf Coast Enclave  
**Alias**: Alpha  
**True Name**: Isaac Reed (known only to a select few)  
**Known Abilities**: Advanced telekinetic powers, psychological manipulation, leadership

##### **Appearance**

Alpha presents himself as a commanding figure, always dressed with a meticulous blend of pre-War formality and
functional Enclave-style combat gear. He is in his mid-50s but exudes a vigorous energy that defies his age. Standing at
about 6 feet tall, Alpha has piercing hazel eyes that seem to scrutinize every detail, giving off an aura of control and
calculation. His short-cropped, silver-streaked hair and clean-shaven face are almost always composed, betraying no
emotion beyond what he chooses to convey. Occasionally, the faint glow of his Ubar necklace peeks out from beneath his
collar, hinting at the power he possesses but never fully explains.

##### **Personality**

Alpha is a master manipulator with a blend of magnetic charisma and terrifying intensity. He commands loyalty through
both admiration and fear, instilling in his followers a belief that his vision alone will lead the Enclave to glory.
Ruthlessly pragmatic, Alpha believes that ends always justify the means, and he shows no mercy toward anyone—ally or
enemy—who might hinder the Enclave’s goals.

While Alpha appears composed and unbreakable, there’s a sinister edge to his ambition. His interactions suggest a man
deeply in love with his own power, viewing others as mere tools. His ultimate goal of becoming a near-deific figure
through the remote-viewing artifacts suggests he sees himself as humanity’s savior—or its overseer.

##### **Background**

Born within the Enclave’s shadowy ranks, Isaac Reed quickly distinguished himself with a shrewd intellect and a knack
for covert operations. He rose through the Enclave’s intelligence division, specializing in subterfuge and infiltration.
During his travels and research into pre-War technology, he discovered a necklace of Ubar origin, which granted him
telekinetic powers and reinforced his belief in his own superiority. Rebranding himself as Alpha, he consolidated power
within the Gulf Coast Enclave, transforming it into a secretive and formidable presence in the Gulf Coast Wasteland.

##### **Abilities and Skills**

- **Telekinesis**: Alpha’s telekinetic powers are both his primary weapon and his most potent intimidation tool. While
  he refrains from using them openly, he has been known to demonstrate his abilities during council meetings or
  confrontations, force-choking dissenters or causing objects to move seemingly on their own. This power keeps his inner
  circle constantly on edge, reinforcing his position of absolute authority.

- **Strategic Genius**: Alpha excels at long-term, multi-layered strategy. His plans involve extensive use of operatives
  embedded in various factions, each unknowingly contributing to the Enclave’s larger goals. He’s a natural strategist
  who uses fear, manipulation, and loyalty to maintain order and control.

- **Psychological Manipulation**: Alpha possesses an intuitive understanding of people and knows how to inspire or
  terrify as needed. His command over council members and operatives comes largely from his psychological prowess,
  knowing precisely when to reward loyalty and when to punish disobedience.

- **Leadership and Charisma**: Alpha has a natural ability to lead, compelling others to follow him even if they
  question his morality. His presence is captivating, and he commands respect with every word and gesture.

##### **Goals and Motivations**

Alpha’s primary motivation is his vision of a “purified” America, ruled by the Enclave and purged of any mutation.
However, his personal ambition extends further: he aims to use the remote-viewing artifacts and the orbital BOMB-001
station to ascend to a level of godlike influence, allowing him to control events from a distance and execute his vision
of a “perfected” world.

**Short-Term Goals**:

- Successfully hijack the Lone Star Republic’s rocket and reach BOMB-001.
- Refine his understanding of the stone head artifact’s abilities, enabling him to amplify his telekinetic reach and
  perhaps even interact with distant events.

**Long-Term Goals**:

- Use the BOMB-001 station to initiate a global “purge,” effectively wiping out any life he deems impure or unnecessary.
- Solidify his place as an unassailable leader of the Gulf Coast Enclave, becoming an untouchable overseer with power
  extending across the wasteland.

##### **Weaknesses**

- **Overconfidence**: Alpha’s belief in his own supremacy can make him underestimate his opponents. He sees himself as a
  cut above anyone he encounters, which may lead him to overlook subtle threats or assume loyalty where it isn’t
  guaranteed.

- **Artifact Dependency**: Much of Alpha’s power hinges on his Ubar necklace. Were he to lose it, he would be physically
  weakened and unable to wield his telekinetic abilities, significantly diminishing his intimidation factor.

- **Isolation from Reality**: Alpha’s obsession with power and his vision of a godlike role has isolated him from the
  realities of human connection. This detachment makes him more reliant on manipulating others rather than forging
  genuine relationships, leading to a brittle support structure where loyalty is often maintained by fear alone.

##### **Role in the Gulf Coast Enclave**

As the supreme leader, Alpha is the Enclave’s central figure, dictating the strategy and coordinating agents across all
major factions. Through selective reveals and strategic disappearances, he has maintained an aura of near-mythic
authority, ensuring that his rule remains unchallenged. His mastery of remote viewing and telekinetic intimidation means
that even his council members do not feel safe in opposing him, creating an environment where absolute obedience is the
norm.

Alpha’s shadow looms over every Enclave operation, and while some council members may harbor doubts or suspicions, none
dare voice them. His ability to control events across the Gulf Coast through manipulation, strategy, and pure force
makes him one of the most dangerous figures in the wasteland, and he intends to extend that influence as far as
possible.

##### Alpha’s Rise to Power

###### Early Background and Initial Ambitions

Before taking the title of **Alpha**, the man who would become the Gulf Coast Enclave’s leader was known simply as *
*Isaac Reed**—a charismatic yet reclusive figure within the Enclave’s intelligence ranks. Reed grew up within the
Enclave’s shadow, inheriting both its dogmatic belief in the purity of humanity and its relentless drive for power. From
a young age, he exhibited an uncanny knack for subterfuge, as well as a unique charisma that drew followers naturally.
Isaac swiftly rose through the ranks, his mind already envisioning a more sophisticated Enclave that wielded its
influence through deep-rooted manipulation rather than brute force.

###### Discovery of the Ubar Artifact

Isaac’s journey took a significant turn in his mid-30s. While tracking down pre-war artifacts and intelligence on
rumored Vault-Tec projects, he heard whispers of a “cursed” excavation site: an ancient facility buried beneath the
desert sands, once owned by **Dunwich Borers** and believed to have housed artifacts from the lost city of Ubar. Local
legends suggested that it was a site of dark magic, with strange events and disappearances plaguing its history.
Intrigued, Isaac set out to uncover the truth for himself, hoping to find an artifact that could further the Enclave’s
knowledge of powerful pre-war technologies.

Inside the desert facility, he unearthed a **necklace unlike any other**: a twisted, vine-like metal encircling a stone
that seemed to pulse faintly with a life of its own. When he donned it, he immediately felt an unsettling energy course
through him, as though his senses had expanded. In time, he found he could channel this power to exert a telekinetic
force over objects around him. Through rigorous practice, he mastered these powers, learning to manipulate small objects
at first, and eventually performing feats of telekinesis that were as deadly as they were awe-inspiring. The artifact
would become his symbol of power and fear, but he kept it hidden from all others, revealing its abilities only as a last
resort.

###### Consolidating Power in the Enclave

Upon returning to the Gulf Coast, Isaac was no longer merely Isaac Reed—he was a man transformed. He took the name *
*Alpha** and began a silent but strategic takeover of the Gulf Coast Enclave’s cells. The Enclave, weakened and
directionless after years of setbacks on the East and West coasts, was fractured and struggling to maintain its
relevance. Alpha saw this chaos as an opportunity, and he knew that to unite the Enclave, he would need to project an
air of authority that left no room for doubt.

He began by ousting several key leaders who still clung to outdated plans of Enclave dominance, seeing them as too rigid
for his vision. When these high-ranking members resisted, Alpha made terrifying displays of his telekinetic powers,
leaving his opponents paralyzed with fear or mysteriously “disappeared.” Rumors of his capabilities spread quickly
within the Enclave, solidifying his rule through both fear and reverence.

Realizing that direct confrontations would ultimately weaken the organization, he restructured the Enclave into **a
council with Greek-letter designations**, maintaining strict anonymity among members to prevent the formation of
factions or mutinies. Council members and agents were allowed only enough information to complete their tasks; no one,
not even the council, understood the full scope of Alpha’s vision. This cell-based structure made it virtually
impossible to trace any plan back to Alpha directly, and the Enclave became a ghostly presence, lurking within the Gulf
Coast Wasteland’s factions.

###### Building the Enclave’s Influence

With Alpha firmly in control, he shifted the Enclave’s focus from direct control to **strategic infiltration**. He
placed his operatives within every major faction, directing them to climb the ranks, gain influence, and gradually shift
policies in ways that served Enclave interests. His approach emphasized subtlety, ensuring that the Enclave’s hand in
regional affairs remained invisible. Alpha demanded that his operatives be flexible, adaptable, and willing to employ
any tactic that furthered the Enclave’s objectives.

As he tightened his grip over the Enclave’s operations, he began to explore his telekinetic abilities, learning how to
use them to influence council members even at a distance. In one chilling display of his power, he force-choked a
council member who had defied him, ensuring that word of his powers would spread among the other members. Council
meetings became strictly formal, and any dissenters were dealt with through Alpha’s shows of force or by vanishing
without a trace.

###### The Discovery of Project Stargaze

Alpha’s ambitions took another turn when informants relayed the existence of **Project Stargaze**—a pre-War Enclave
project centered around lunar artifacts believed to have mystical remote-viewing capabilities. The discovery of these
artifacts, especially the large stone head and the smaller charms, rekindled Alpha’s dreams of absolute control. If he
could master the remote-viewing technology, he could influence events beyond even the Gulf Coast, potentially allowing
the Enclave to re-establish its dominance across the wasteland.

When an informant reported seeing visions of the past Enclave operatives discussing the head’s potential to conduct
long-distance, interaction-based remote viewing, Alpha recognized its potential as a godlike tool. His visions expanded,
and he began to plan beyond mere regional dominance, imagining a future where he could project his consciousness
anywhere, striking fear and bending reality to his will. To him, the stone head represented the culmination of his
power, a conduit through which he could become a deific figure, omnipresent and omnipotent.

###### Ascension to a New Enclave

Under Alpha’s leadership, the Gulf Coast Enclave transformed into a disciplined and secretive organization with agents
embedded in every significant faction. To all operatives, he remained an enigma—his true identity unknown, his powers
seemingly limitless, and his vision godlike. He has since instilled in the Enclave an unwavering loyalty to his vision,
promising them a place in the “new America” that will rise after the BOMB-001 orbital station purges the wasteland of
mutants and radiated impurities.

###### Alpha’s Long-Term Vision

While the Enclave’s primary objective remains to re-establish a pure America, Alpha’s true ambitions extend far beyond
this. He envisions himself as an eternal ruler, wielding his telekinetic powers and the remote-viewing capabilities of
the stone head to shape the future as he sees fit. His plan to purge the Earth is merely the beginning; Alpha believes
that with the moon artifacts, he can ascend to a level of power that renders him almost godlike.

##### Key Traits and Powers of Alpha

- **Telekinesis**: Alpha’s mastery of his Ubar artifact allows him to move objects, immobilize enemies, and create
  terrifying displays of force.
- **Intimidation and Charisma**: Alpha’s sheer presence commands respect and fear. Council members follow him out of a
  combination of loyalty, awe, and terror, and he is known for eliminating dissent in swift, brutal ways.
- **Machiavellian Strategy**: Alpha is a master manipulator. He uses the Enclave’s cell-based structure to isolate
  members and prevent any collective resistance to his rule.
- **Long-Term Vision**: Alpha’s view of leadership is generational. He sees himself as the Enclave’s eternal patriarch
  and envisions a future where his remote presence becomes an indelible force across the wasteland.

##### Alpha’s Legacy in the Gulf Coast Enclave

Through his telekinetic powers, unyielding discipline, and strategic genius, Alpha has transformed the Gulf Coast
Enclave into a nearly invisible power broker, orchestrating events and controlling factions with precision. Under Alpha,
the Enclave is no longer a brute-force military force—it is a specter, a myth, and a quietly dominant presence that
controls events from the shadows. And while his council harbors suspicions about his growing god-complex, they are
ultimately left with no choice but to obey, believing he alone can lead them to the restoration of their “pure” America.

In Alpha’s eyes, he isn’t just leading the Enclave—he’s shaping the very fabric of the wasteland, poised to become its
ultimate ruler, whether by remote view or by physical force. His plans, and the loyalty he’s cultivated through fear and
charisma, have set the stage for the Gulf Coast Enclave’s most ambitious operation yet, and the wasteland may soon learn
that his influence runs deeper than anyone imagined.



## Unique Powers and Artifacts

**Alpha’s Telekinetic Powers**
Alpha’s mysterious necklace, obtained from a desert facility of the ancient Ubar civilization, grants him limited
telekinetic powers, allowing him to demonstrate “divine” authority over the council. He uses his abilities for
intimidation, manipulating council members, and keeping dissenters in line. He has also harnessed this power for crowd
control and intimidation in rare encounters outside the council.

**The Stone Head and Charms**
The Enclave’s moon artifacts, especially the large stone head, are carefully guarded and used for experimental remote
viewing. Enclave agents occasionally experience “visions,” allowing them to observe events and communicate with distant
agents. These artifacts remain central to Alpha’s ultimate goal of gaining omnipotent influence.

## Influence with Other Factions
### Lone Star Republic

#### Overview:
The Enclave sees the LSR as an ideal tool for their technological and expansion goals, particularly for gathering resources and spearheading rocket construction. Through their agents, they keep the LSR moving forward on projects that align with the Enclave’s endgame while subtly limiting their militaristic ambitions to prevent any potential threat to the Enclave’s plan.

#### Key Enclave Actions in the LSR

1. **Control Over Technological Growth and Rocket Development**
   * **Agent Role**: The Enclave uses their embedded agents to encourage the LSR’s focus on scientific and technological projects, especially related to space exploration.
   * **Key Agents**:
     - **Congressman Theodore Wilcox (Beta)** uses his political clout to secure LSR funding and legislative support for technology-focused endeavors, justifying these as patriotic investments.
     - **Nina Valdez (Kappa)** in engineering supervises the diversion of resources toward the spaceport, delaying LSR military development and instead prioritizing technical projects that benefit the rocket construction.

2. **Scavenging Expeditions and Artifact Recovery**
   * **Agent Role**: Through influence over the LSR’s decision-making, Enclave agents steer the Republic to commit resources to scavenging missions essential to the Enclave’s goals.
   * **Key Agent**:
     - **Charles Haliburton (Sigma)**, as Deputy Overseer at the Spaceport Vault, acts as a liaison between the LSR and Spaceport Survivors, enabling collaborative expeditions to gather both rocket parts and moon artifacts. His strategic positioning allows him to quietly secure any sensitive discoveries before they reach LSR leaders like Sarah Dawson.

3. **Politically-Driven Resource Acquisition**
   * **Agent Role**: The Enclave ensures that critical resources, especially energy and technical supplies, are directed away from potential LSR military buildup and instead used for projects beneficial to the Enclave’s goals.
   * **Key Agent**:
     - **Wilcox** works in Congress to adjust funding priorities, justifying it as a means to prepare the Republic for an energy-secure future. By directing LSR interest toward the spaceport, he keeps focus away from oil reserves and other assets that the Oil Barons (also influenced by the Enclave) are quietly securing.

4. **Subtle Restriction of LSR Military Expansion**
   * **Agent Role**: Prevent any buildup of military force that could threaten the Enclave’s objectives, especially once conflict around the spaceport begins.
   * **Key Agents**:
     - **Wilcox** and **Valdez** carefully adjust rhetoric to emphasize that the LSR’s future lies in technology, exploration, and resource acquisition. Their messaging encourages restraint, while reinforcing the idea that conflict is best handled diplomatically or through controlled skirmishes, preventing full-scale mobilization.

#### Enclave-LSR Dynamic in Phases

1. **Early Phases**: As the LSR strengthens its infrastructure and technological capabilities, Enclave agents ensure the Republic remains dependent on the spaceport project, channeling support for scavenging expeditions and technological advancements rather than military dominance.
   
2. **Conflict Phase**: With tensions increasing around the spaceport, Enclave operatives stoke enough conflict for the Republic to take part without turning it into an all-out war. The controlled unrest allows the Enclave to keep the LSR engaged, diverting attention and resources from discovering the Enclave’s deeper plans.

3. **Rocket Launch Phase**: In the lead-up to the launch, agents maintain LSR focus on the mission’s symbolic and resource-driven significance, keeping them from asking questions about the true purpose of the mission or potential operatives onboard. The LSR’s role has been fully exhausted by this point, and they’re poised for a final betrayal if needed.



### *Spaceport Survivors

#### Overview:
The Enclave views the Spaceport Survivors as a highly valuable resource for their technological capabilities and expertise in rocket construction. The Survivors' commitment to space exploration aligns perfectly with Enclave goals, making it relatively easy to manipulate their objectives toward the eventual manned launch. However, the Survivors’ isolation and mission-driven focus require careful management to avoid suspicion, especially given their historical independence. 
The Spaceport Survivors’ isolationist mindset and zeal for space exploration make them a pliable, if unwitting, tool in the Enclave’s operation. This faction allows the Enclave to harness advanced technology and engineering without revealing the final aim, keeping the Survivors focused on their launch dreams until the final phase. 

#### Key Enclave Actions in the Spaceport Survivors

1. **Direct Control of Rocket Construction**
   * **Agent Role**: Enclave agents leverage the Survivors’ expertise and facilities to ensure the manned rocket’s completion, subtly incorporating mission-critical systems that enable Enclave agents to hijack the launch.
   * **Key Agent**:
     - **Charles Haliburton (Sigma)**, as Deputy Overseer, uses his high-ranking position to oversee the construction schedule and divert any discoveries or technologies that could reveal the Enclave’s plan. His direct access to the Survivors’ engineering blueprints and personnel allows him to influence key decisions, such as adding specialized controls for the Enclave’s takeover of the launch.

2. **Encouraging Controlled Knowledge of the Spaceport’s Potential**
   * **Agent Role**: Keep the Survivors focused on their space mission without providing them the full scope of what the launch entails. Agents restrict information about BOMB-001 or the Enclave’s deeper goals to prevent curiosity from interfering.
   * **Key Agent**:
     - **Haliburton** manages information flow between the Enclave and the Survivors, ensuring that only knowledge necessary for rocket construction is shared. When new data or inquiries arise—such as mentions of satellite connections or military applications—he dismisses them as unrelated to the space mission, keeping the Survivors focused on their space exploration ideals.

3. **Use of Moon Artifacts to Facilitate Enclave Communication and Security**
   * **Agent Role**: The moon artifacts, including the large stone head, serve as a tool for remote viewing, allowing the Enclave to monitor Survivor progress without intrusive in-person oversight. This also limits the need for additional operatives within the spaceport, reducing the risk of discovery.
   * **Key Agent**:
     - **Alpha** personally oversees the use of the stone head, using it to check in on the Survivors’ progress or project into meetings with Haliburton remotely. Haliburton himself helps obscure the nature of the head from other Survivors, occasionally dismissing its presence as a relic of “early space research” to dissuade curiosity.

4. **Manipulating the Survivors’ Isolation and Idealism**
   * **Agent Role**: The Enclave plays on the Survivors’ deep-rooted isolationist ideals and dedication to space exploration, fueling their enthusiasm for the launch. This keeps the Survivors working toward the launch, unaware that their goal aligns with a hidden agenda.
   * **Key Agent**:
     - **Haliburton** reinforces a sense of unity around the idea of space as a symbol of human resilience, even creating divisions between the Survivors and other factions. He leverages this loyalty to keep the Survivors from seeking alliances outside the spaceport, thereby preventing them from learning more about the Enclave’s presence in other factions.

---

#### Enclave-Spaceport Survivor Dynamic in Phases

1. **Early Phases**: The Enclave uses the Survivors’ isolation to direct rocket construction with minimal oversight. By limiting the Survivors’ knowledge of external factions or the significance of the mission, they maintain focus on the launch as a pure scientific endeavor.

2. **Conflict Phase**: As interest from the LSR and Pirates heightens around the spaceport, Enclave agents encourage the Survivors to view this interest as potential interference. Haliburton emphasizes the importance of focusing on the launch above all else, subtly undermining any push for the Survivors to interact with the Gulf Coast factions.

3. **Rocket Launch Phase**: By the time of the launch, the Survivors remain unaware of the Enclave’s onboard operatives or the rocket’s true mission. Their long-standing isolation, reinforced by Enclave influence, prevents them from realizing that their facilities and work are about to be hijacked for the Enclave’s plans.


### Oil Barons

#### Overview:
The Enclave sees the Oil Barons as a strategic asset, especially for their economic power and control over the region's energy resources. With Leonard Petrovich’s ambitious Securitron army project, the Oil Barons hold a potential game-changer for regional dominance. While Petrovich is unaware of the Enclave’s existence, **Thomas Phillips (Epsilon)** is positioned to execute a coup, wresting control of the Securitron army and aligning it with Enclave objectives.


#### Key Enclave Actions in the Oil Barons

1. **Phillips’ Plan for a Securitron Army Coup**
   * **Goal**: Phillips, while supporting Petrovich’s Securitron project, works behind the scenes to undermine him. His end goal is to take control of the Securitron army and leverage it to strengthen the Enclave’s strategic position.
   * **Actions**:
     - **Subverting Key Personnel**: Phillips has covertly recruited key technicians and engineers working under Petrovich on the Securitron project, building loyalty through promises of rewards or fear of repercussions. By the time the Securitron army nears completion, Phillips will have enough allies to disable Petrovich’s command.
     - **Targeted Sabotage**: Phillips arranges minor “technical setbacks” to delay completion timelines, giving him more time to consolidate his hold over the army.
     - **Operational Plan**: Once ready, Phillips plans to have Petrovich isolated from his executive team under the pretext of a high-stakes meeting or “inspection” during which Phillips’ allies can activate a Securitron override and seize control.

2. **Securing Resources and Technology Flow to the Spaceport**
   * **Goal**: Phillips directs Oil Baron resources to sustain the spaceport project without raising Petrovich’s suspicions.
   * **Actions**:
     - **Disguising Resource Allocation**: Phillips funnels resources to the spaceport under the guise of “investment opportunities,” subtly ensuring that key technologies and supplies reach the Enclave’s hands while Petrovich’s interest remains fixed on his own projects.

3. **Driving Regional Tension through Economic Control**
   * **Goal**: Amplify control over fuel and energy to escalate regional tensions, setting the stage for the Enclave’s eventual takeover.
   * **Actions**:
     - **Fuel Pricing and Restrictions**: Phillips manipulates energy costs and supply lines to ensure that neither the Lone Star Republic nor the Galveston Pirates can acquire resources without steep prices or conditions. This forces the factions to stay at odds, distracting them from uniting against the Enclave.

4. **Maintaining Petrovich’s Focus on Expansion, Not Inquiry**
   * **Goal**: Phillips keeps Petrovich occupied with personal ambitions, particularly through the Securitron project, ensuring he doesn’t suspect Enclave interference.
   * **Actions**:
     - **Promising Autonomy and Power**: Phillips occasionally hints at lucrative expansions or undisclosed opportunities beyond the Gulf Coast, feeding Petrovich’s vision of consolidating a post-war energy empire. This helps divert Petrovich’s focus away from Phillips’ actions, keeping him unaware of the Enclave’s ultimate motives.


#### Enclave-Oil Baron Dynamic in Phases

1. **Early Phases**: Phillips positions himself strategically within Petrovich’s projects, gaining influence over key staff and resources. Petrovich remains preoccupied with the Securitron army, which Phillips quietly prepares to seize.

2. **Conflict Phase**: Phillips amplifies fuel restrictions, aggravating other factions and creating regional unrest that suits Enclave objectives. Petrovich, embroiled in the Securitron project, is blind to Phillips’ manipulations.

3. **Coup and Rocket Launch Phase**: Just before or around the rocket launch, Phillips executes the coup against Petrovich, securing the Securitron army and eliminating Petrovich’s influence. This army then becomes an Enclave asset, reinforcing their control over the Gulf Coast at a critical moment.


Here’s the adjusted influence guide for the **Galveston Pirates**, with Maraña’s gradual rise in influence and the potential for her to gain a formal seat on the Council—and even invoke the position of “Pirate King” if necessary.

### Galveston Pirates

#### Overview
The Enclave sees the Galveston Pirates as valuable agents of disruption, using their penchant for raids and chaos to create instability among other factions. Although Isabella Maraña is not on the Pirate Council at the start, she is a respected figure within Pirate ranks. Her role as an Enclave operative is to cultivate influence, especially by maneuvering into a Council position, which would grant her formal sway over Pirate activities. As the prospect of open conflict grows, she may even invoke an ancient custom to appoint herself as the temporary “Pirate King,” granting her the authority to steer Pirate actions directly in line with Enclave plans.


#### Key Enclave Actions in the Galveston Pirates

1. **Gaining Influence in Pirate Leadership and Securing a Council Position**
   * **Goal**: The Enclave’s immediate aim is to elevate Captain Maraña to a position on the Pirate Council, allowing her greater formal influence. This access would enable the Enclave to more openly direct Pirate resources and operations toward destabilizing rival factions.
   * **Key Agent**:
     - **Captain Isabella Maraña (Upsilon)** leverages her respect among the Pirate crews to build support, positioning herself as a logical choice for the Council. As conflict brews in the Gulf Coast, the Enclave encourages her to emphasize her experience and knowledge of strategic raiding to appeal to other captains. Meanwhile, Phillips covertly supports this push by ensuring the Oil Barons maintain steady weapon and supply trades with her, increasing her perceived value among the Pirates.

2. **Directed Raiding and Targeted Disruption**
   * **Goal**: Keep rival factions’ supply lines disrupted, particularly those supporting Lone Star Republic interests, by influencing Pirate actions. 
   * **Key Agent**:
     - Until she holds a Council position, **Maraña** directs her own crew’s raids toward Enclave-friendly targets, framing these as profitable opportunities that naturally support Pirate independence. Her crew’s successes create the impression of her being a powerful asset, increasing her appeal as a Council candidate.

3. **Possible Invocation of “Pirate King” Custom**
   * **Goal**: If a Council position alone proves insufficient, the Enclave will encourage Maraña to invoke an ancient custom among the Pirates allowing the appointment of a temporary “Pirate King.” This role grants executive authority over all Pirate crews, enabling her to steer Pirate activities decisively in favor of the Enclave’s plans.
   * **Key Agent**:
     - At the Enclave’s urging, **Maraña** could invoke this tradition, presenting it as necessary to unite the Pirates under one leadership amid growing threats. As “Pirate King,” she would hold unparalleled authority, with the power to command all crews to target specific factions and resources strategically aligned with Enclave interests.

4. **Limiting Knowledge of the Enclave’s Broader Plan**
   * **Goal**: Prevent the Pirates from uncovering the Enclave’s larger goals. Any unusual encounters or suspicions are discredited as tall tales, keeping the Pirates from probing too deeply into Maraña’s actions.
   * **Key Agent**:
     - **Maraña** dismisses stories about Enclave activities, framing them as superstitions or fabricated tales by rival factions to scare Pirates away from valuable targets. This keeps the crews, even those suspicious of her rise in influence, from looking further into her true affiliations.

#### Enclave-Pirate Dynamic in Phases

1. **Early Phases**: Maraña’s rise to influence is supported by the Enclave, particularly by keeping her crew well-supplied through Oil Baron intermediaries. Her focus remains on gaining favor among Pirate leadership to establish herself as a viable candidate for the Council.

2. **Conflict Phase**: As tensions escalate, Maraña’s value becomes clear to the other Pirate captains, paving the way for her to join the Council. If she faces resistance, Enclave support for her invoking the “Pirate King” title could provide the necessary authority, uniting the Pirates under her command.

3. **Rocket Launch Phase**: As “Pirate King” or as a newly minted Council member, Maraña commands Pirate raids to hit supply lines critical to the Lone Star Republic and other factions. This chaos serves as a distraction during the Enclave’s final phases, ensuring that rival factions are too occupied to interfere with the rocket launch or Enclave objectives.
