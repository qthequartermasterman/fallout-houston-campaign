# Enclave

**Main article: [Enclave (from the Fallout Wiki)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Enclave)**

The Enclave is a secretive political, scientific, and militaristic organization that is descended directly from members
of the pre-War United States government, and claims to be the legally-sanctioned continuation of the government of the
United States. After major defeats on the West Coast and in the Capital Wasteland (in Fallout 2 and 3, respectively),
the Enclave has been reduced to a shadow of its former self. Splinter groups and remnants of the Enclave continue to
exist, however, and some still seek to restore the Enclave to its former glory. There are two such groups in the Gulf
Coast Wasteland: The Spaceport Enclave and the Oil Baron Enclave. Both of these groups do not consider themselves to be
splinter groups, but rather secret cells put in place for some future purpose. Their members are also members of their 
other corresponding organization, tasked with leading those groups to secretly fulfill Enclave goals. They have been 
aware of each other since long before [emergence of the Spaceport Survivors](background.md#discovery-of-the-spaceport-survivors), this is
significant, as the Spaceport Survivors _writ large_ are otherwise completely isolated from the outside world.

## Pre-war Enclave

In the Fallout universe, the Enclave is a secretive and powerful faction that traces its roots back to before the Great War. The Enclave was originally formed by remnants of the pre-war United States government and military, who sought to ensure the survival of humanity in the event of a nuclear apocalypse.

Before the Great War, the Enclave operated in the shadows, carrying out experiments and research in isolated facilities such as the Poseidon Oil Rig. They were responsible for the development of advanced technologies and biological weapons. The Enclave believed in the idea of "pure humanity" and considered themselves the last bastion of the pre-war government and society.

When the Great War occurred, the Enclave went into hiding in their remote facilities, protected from the devastating effects of the nuclear war. Over the years, they continued their experiments and plans for the future. The Enclave's goal was to rebuild the United States, but only with what they deemed as genetically pure humans, often showing a disregard for mutated creatures and wasteland inhabitants.

### Feud with Vault-Tec
!!! warning
    This section, while not contradicting any canon, is not canon itself. It is a fan theory that this campaign builds upon.

Vault-Tec was a pre-war corporation contracted by the United States Government to construct and operate many Vaults as part of Project Safehouse. The Enclave, a shadow organization within the United States Government, conspired with Vault-Tec to use the Vaults to conduct experiments on the American population, to see how they would react to various conditions, in an effort to gather data in preparation for colonizing another planet. The Enclave's goal was to ensure that only the "purest" humans would be allowed to leave Earth, and the Vaults were a way to test the population and determine who was worthy of leaving.

While high-ranking members of Vault-Tec were aware of the Enclave, and indeed conspired with them, those same corporate leaders believed that Vault-Tec would be able to use the Vaults to sieze power and exert influence over the post-war world, independent of existing governments and organizations, including the Enclave. Many believe that Vault-Tec themselves started the Great War, in order to execute their plans. And indeed, their actions after the bombs fell, such as attempts to [seize control of Nuclear Silos in Appalachia](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_76_overseer#post-war), confirm that they had plans to exert control over the post-war world.

Even many years before the bombs fell, the Enclave grew suspicious of Vault-Tec's impending betrayal, and began to plan for a way to stop them. Indeed, it was the Enclave who prompted the lunar [Chinese Attack on the Vault-Tec Tranquility Mining Operation](dawn_of_tranquility.md). They also worked to sabotage certain Vaults that the Enclave deemd "unnecessary" to their plans, and planted hidden Enclave cells within other, more important Vaults, such as [Vault 117](spaceportsurvivors.md).
