# Oil Barons

## Overview
- **Overview:** The Oil Barons are an economic conglomerate with control over various power sources,
  including oil and nuclear energy. They may have ties to pre-war corporations.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Economic Power: They exert significant influence over the wasteland's economy and control the production and
      distribution of essential resources.
    - Mysterious Origins: Their connections to pre-war companies, such as Poseidon Energy, suggest a hidden history and
      potentially nefarious intentions.
- **Notable Figures:**
    - Leonard Petrovich: A high-ranking member of the Oil Barons, responsible for resource management
      and trade negotiations. Ghoul who, prior to the Great War, was a high-ranking executive at Poseidon Energy.
    - Dr. Emily Wells: A scientist rumored to be working on advanced energy technologies within their ranks.
- **Conflict:** The Oil and Energy Barons' monopoly over power sources has contributed to the energy crisis, leading to
  tension with other factions and the Lone Star Republic's aggressive actions.
- **Goals for Spaceport**:
    - The Oil Barons see the spaceport as a potential source of advanced technology and materials, which
      could be used to improve their energy production capabilities. They aim to secure these resources by any means
      necessary, including raiding the spaceport or sabotaging the Lone Star Republic's efforts.
    - They oppose any further rocket launches, and they aim to prevent the Lone Star Republic from launching a manned
      rocket. This could include sabotaging the launch or capturing the spaceport for themselves.
    - One group, led by Leonard Petrovich himself, believe that going into space before the Great War was a mistake, as the
      space race is what led to the resource wars and the Great War itself.
    - Others among the Oil Barons oppose it for less ideological reasons, merely because they see it as a threat to
      their fragile dominance over the region's energy resources.
    - Enclave agents among the Oil and Energy Barons, having re-established contact with the Enclave cell within the
      Spaceport Survivors, are providing external influence to help the Enclave cell hijack the mission. They hope to
      use the captured orbital station not only to further the Enclave's goals, but also to personally gain control over
      the Oil Barons themselves by threatening to use the station's nuclear missiles against off-shore oil rigs and other key energy infrastructure.

## Characters
### Leonard Petrovich
Before the bombs fell, Leonard Petrovich (2049-) was a shrewd and ambitious executive in the pre-war energy industry. He is an heir to the Petrovich family fortune, being the 5th great-grandson of the legendary John Petrovich, who founded the Normal Energy Company in the late 19th century which by 1900 controlled an effective monopoly on America's energy production. With a background in corporate strategy and a knack for navigating the cutthroat world of business (as well as ample funding from his family trust), at the age of 27 he managed to secure a position of influence within [Poseidon Energy](companies.md#poseidon-energy), one of the major energy corporations. When the Great War unfolded in 2077, Leonard found himself trapped in the chaos, facing the impending nuclear apocalypse.

Leonard was among the handful of survivors from [Vault 26](vaults.md#vault-26-the-failed-demise-of-the-oil-barons), and fueled by spite and a desire for revenge against Vault-Tec, he (and his other now-ghoulified vault-mates) set out to rebuild their energy empires.  Driven by a relentless determination to rebuild and capitalize on the remaining resources, Leonard set out to unite the scattered remnants of old-world oil companies. Through negotiations, alliances, and strategic acquisitions, he successfully formed Phoenix Energy, a formidable force in the post-apocalyptic energy market.

Leonard Petrovich, with his sharp mind and business acumen, became known as "The Resilient Reclaimer." He focuses on restoring and expanding the oil industry, viewing it as a crucial element for rebuilding civilization in the wasteland. Despite the challenges, Leonard is a pragmatic leader, willing to make tough decisions to ensure the survival and prosperity of his conglomerate in the harsh, post-apocalyptic world. His overarching goal is to secure a lasting legacy, not just for himself but for the future generations who will rely on the energy resources he seeks to control.

### Dr. Emily Wells

Dr. Emily Wells, a formidable engineer and a visionary thinker, was born and raised in the heart of the Lone Star Republic. From an early age, she displayed an insatiable curiosity and a natural talent for all things technical. Growing up amidst the ruins of the post-apocalyptic world, Emily witnessed firsthand the desperation and struggles of her community. Determined to play a role in reshaping their destiny, she set out on a path to become one of the Republic's leading engineers.

Emily's journey to prominence began when she arrived in Scholar's Summit to study at the University, the intellectual hub and educational fulcrum of the Lone Star Republic. At Scholar's Summit, she immersed herself in the study of engineering, driven by a deep-rooted desire to understand and harness the power of technology. Guided by passionate professors and mentors, Emily quickly distinguished herself as a prodigious student with an exceptional aptitude for problem-solving.

Her studies took her on a voyage through the remnants of pre-war knowledge, where she explored disciplines ranging from mechanical engineering to energy systems. She delved deep into the intricacies of robotics, understanding the inner workings of machines that once seemed like magic in the pre-war world. Emily's insatiable curiosity drove her to push boundaries, to question established norms, and to dream of a future where the Lone Star Republic could rise above the ashes of the past.

As a proud graduate of Scholar's Summit, Emily was revered for her innovative mindset and her groundbreaking research. She became renowned for her expertise in energy systems and sustainable technologies, always seeking new ways to improve the lives of the Republic's citizens and address the pressing energy crisis that plagued their settlements. Her relentless pursuit of knowledge and her willingness to challenge conventional thinking made her a prominent voice in the Republic's scientific community.

However, Emily's steadfast commitment to the Lone Star Republic's future was tested when the Oil Barons tightened their control over energy resources. The Oil Barons' domination stifled progress and innovation, leaving the Republic vulnerable and dependent on their domain. The ambitious engineer despised the Oil Barons' iron grip and the limitations they placed on the potential of the Republic. She saw their restrictive policies as a direct obstruction to the prosperity and advancement of her people.

As fate would have it, during a [critical negotiation with the Oil Barons](lonestarrepublic.md#negotiation-for-oilfield-outpost-2286), Emily encountered Leonard Petrovich, a key representative of the faction. Their discussions were intense, filled with spirited debates and tense exchanges. However, through the heated words and impassioned arguments, an unspoken connection began to form between them. They recognized in each other a shared vision of progress and a longing for a brighter future.

In a surprising turn of events, Leonard Petrovich offered Emily a unique opportunityâ€”to join the Oil Barons and work on ["special projects"](#the-secret-project-securitron-army) that would shape the future of the faction's energy operations. Intrigued by the prospect of unraveling the secrets locked away within the Oil Barons' grasp, and driven by a deep sense of loyalty to her people, Emily accepted the offer, leaving behind her close friend, Sarah Dawson, who saw this as a personal betrayal.

Within the confines of the Oil Barons' labs, Emily's brilliance found a new stage. She spearheaded cutting-edge research, pushing the boundaries of energy production and innovation. Most importantly, she helped architect Leonard Petrovich's Securitron army. Through all of this, Emily's commitment to her people never wavered, and she worked tirelessly to uncover solutions that would liberate her former home, the Lone Star Republic, from the shackles of the Oil Barons' control. As her project with the Securitrons drew to a close, she began to fear for her home and installed a backdoor into their programming, and she began to secretly work on a plan to return to the Lone Star Republic, and if Petrovich became too dangerous, to use the backdoor to disable the Securitron Army.

## History
### Pre-War History
### Failure of Vault 26
**Main Article: [Vault 26: The Failed Demise of the Oil Barons](vaults.md#vault-26-the-failed-demise-of-the-oil-barons)**

Vault 26, commissioned by pre-war energy giants like Poseidon Energy, Red Rocket, and Womb-ee's, was secretly designed by Vault-Tec to fail as an act of spite against the energy companies. Intended as a "luxury" Vault, it experienced a brief period of opulence before its air filters malfunctioned days after the Nuclear Armageddon, flooding the Vault with the toxic outside atmosphere. The rigged vault door ensured no escape after life support failure, leading to pandemonium and infighting among residents. Most succumbed to radiation sickness, while a few, including Leonard Petrovich, survived as ghouls. Months later, the survivors hacked their way out and, having reclaimed pre-war energy sources, destroyed the Vault on the fifth anniversary of the Great War. They erected a symbol of their resilience, a massive oil derrick, in the Energy Corridor west of Houston, marking the rise of the Oil Barons as a dominant regional power.

### Forming the Oil Barons


### Rise of the Lone Star Republic
**Main Article: [Tension with the Oil Barons](lonestarrepublic.md#tension-with-the-oil-barons-2284-)**

As the Lone Star Republic solidified its presence in the Houston region, the Oil Barons played a crucial role in shaping its destiny. Their wealth and influence propelled the rise of the Republic, but as their power waned, tension between the two factions began to brew. 

When the Lone Star Republic began its struggle against the cartels, the Oil Barons realized the potential benefits of supporting this emerging force. They provided financial backing to the Republic's military endeavors, seeing an opportunity to cleanse Houston of the cartels while maintaining their grip on the energy resources. Their financial support ensured that the Republic had the necessary resources to fight the cartels effectively.

However, as the war drew to a close and the Lone Star Republic emerged victorious, the Oil Barons' relationship with the new governing power began to deteriorate. Initially, they believed that their support during the war would guarantee their continued influence over the region. But as the Republic's ambitions grew and its attention turned towards the expansion of its territory and acquisition of resources, discontent began to grow among the Oil Barons.

The tension between the Oil Barons and the Lone Star Republic came to a head during the Lone Star Republic Election of 2285. While the Oil Barons had initially supported and funded the Republic's endeavors, they now saw their influence waning and felt the need to protect their interests. Alexander Sullivan and the Unity Party's focus on unity, diplomacy, and a cooperative approach posed a direct challenge to the Oil Barons' control. The Expansionist Party, led by General Samuel Davis, sought to negotiate better terms with the Oil Barons but still aimed for the Republic's expansion, leaving the Barons wary and concerned about their diminishing influence.

In the aftermath of the election, tensions between the Oil Barons and the Lone Star Republic persisted. The Oil Barons, fearing further encroachment on their power, tightened their control over oil and nuclear energy resources in an attempt to limit the Republic's expansion. This move restricted the Republic's ability to grow, stalling their military ambitions and frustrating their efforts to secure vital resources for their population.

The Lone Star Republic found themselves in a precarious position, in a struggle against a faction that had once supported and financed their rise to power. As the Oil Barons consolidated their hold over energy resources, the Republic faced the challenge of finding alternative energy solutions to break free from the Barons' control.

### Negotiation for Oilfield Outpost (2286)
**Main Article: [Negotiation for Oilfield Output](lonestarrepublic.md#negotiation-for-oilfield-outpost-2286)**

### The Secret Project: Securitron Army
!!! warning
    As written, this section assumes that Mr. House won the Battle of Hoover Dam in **Fallout: New Vegas**. If the gamemaster chooses to use a different ending as canon for their campaign, they should adjust this section accordingly. Possible ideas may include the Oil Barons finding remains of the Securitron Army while exploring around New Vegas.

Before the Great War, Leonard Petrovich's father, Bill Petrovich (who later died in Vault 26), was a business associate and close friend of Robert House, the founder of RobCo Industries. Bill Petrovich was a key investor in the development of the Securitron Project. Eventually, House adapted the Securitron technology to create the Securitron Army, a massive army of Securitrons that would be used to defend New Vegas and the Hoover Dam. 

After hearing rumors of the events at Hoover Dam, Leonard Petrovich sent a team of negotiators to New Vegas to establish diplomatic relations and perform some reconnaissance on potential business deals with New Vegas, and/or surrounding nations (such as NCR or Caesar's Legion). After hearing that Mr. House himself was indeed alive, and that he had a massive army of Securitrons at his disposal, Leonard Petrovich became obsessed with acquiring a Securitron Army for his own company, to allow him to expand his influence and power much more effectively, as lack of man-power and firepower was a major limiting factor for the Oil Barons. Petrovich took a visit to New Vegas himself, and met with Mr. House. After a long discussion, House agreed to sell Phoenix Energy five Securitrons in exchange for a large sum of money and a non-compete agreement that gave Mr. House exclusive rights to sell energy to the New California Republic. Mr. House refused, however, to provide any resources in helping Petrovich assemble his own army of Securitrons, including programming and schematics.

After seeing the technical and diplomatic prowess of [Dr. Emily Wells](#dr-emily-wells), Petrovich approached her after the [Negotiation for Oilfield Output](lonestarrepublic.md#negotiation-for-oilfield-outpost-2286), and asked her to lead a team of engineers to reverse-engineer the Securitrons and create a Securitron Army for the Oil Barons. Dr. Wells agreed, and the project began in secret. After just under two years of work, the project was approximately 80% completed, with only manufacturing and field testing remaining. Despite this secret advantage, Leonard Petrovich's obsession with control led him to believe that the Securitron Army was not enough, and that he needed aerial superiority as well. 

As she became more aware of Petrovich's mania and increasing desire to control the region, even at the cost of exterminating her home nation of the Lone Star Republic, Dr. Wells began to have second thoughts about the project. She began to fear that Petrovich would use the Securitron Army to take over the Lone Star Republic, and that she would be responsible for the destruction of her home. While she could not stop the project, and it was too far along to successfully sabotage, she did manage to leave herself a remote (albeit limited) backdoor in the Securitron programming. She began to secretly work on a plan to return to the Lone Star Republic, and if Petrovich became too dangerous, to use the backdoor to disable the Securitron Army.
