# The Oil and Energy Barons

## Overview
- **Overview:** The Oil and Energy Barons are an economic conglomerate with control over various power sources,
  including oil and nuclear energy. They may have ties to pre-war corporations.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Economic Power: They exert significant influence over the wasteland's economy and control the production and
      distribution of essential resources.
    - Mysterious Origins: Their connections to pre-war companies, such as Poseidon Energy, suggest a hidden history and
      potentially nefarious intentions.
- **Notable Figures:**
    - Leonard "Ironclad" Duvall: A high-ranking member of the Oil and Energy Barons, responsible for resource management
      and trade negotiations. Ghoul who, prior to the Great War, was a high-ranking executive at Poseidon Energy.
    - Dr. Emily Wells: A scientist rumored to be working on advanced energy technologies within their ranks.
- **Conflict:** The Oil and Energy Barons' monopoly over power sources has contributed to the energy crisis, leading to
  tension with other factions and the Lone Star Republic's aggressive actions.
- **Goals for Spaceport**:
    - The Oil and Energy Barons see the spaceport as a potential source of advanced technology and materials, which
      could be used to improve their energy production capabilities. They aim to secure these resources by any means
      necessary, including raiding the spaceport or sabotaging the Lone Star Republic's efforts.
    - They oppose any further rocket launches, and they aim to prevent the Lone Star Republic from launching a manned
      rocket. This could include sabotaging the launch or capturing the spaceport for themselves.
    - One group, led by Leonard Duvall himself, believe that going into space before the Great War was a mistake, as the
      space race is what led to the resource wars and the Great War itself.
    - Others among the Oil Barons oppose it for less ideological reasons, merely because they see it as a threat to
      their fragile dominance over the region's energy resources.
    - Enclave agents among the Oil and Energy Barons, having re-established contact with the Enclave cell within the
      Spaceport Survivors, are providing external influence to help the Enclave cell hijack the mission. They hope to
      use the captured orbital station not only to further the Enclave's goals, but also to personally gain control over
      the Oil and Energy Barons themselves by threatening to use the station's nuclear missiles against off-shore oil
      rigs and other key energy infrastructure.
