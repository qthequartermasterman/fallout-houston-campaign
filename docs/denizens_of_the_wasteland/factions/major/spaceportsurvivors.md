# Spaceport Survivors

## Overview
- **Overview:** The Spaceport Survivors are descendants of USSA astronauts, scientists, and military personnel who
  survived in a hidden vault beneath the Houston Space Center.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Secret Vault: They operate from Vault 117, a hidden mission control center beneath the Johnson Space Center,
      preserving the legacy of space exploration.
    - Space Ambitions: The Spaceport Survivors are preparing for a historic manned rocket launch, the first of its kind
      since the Great War, as they aim to continue humanity's space exploration legacy.
- **Notable Figures:**
    - Director Catherine "Stardust" Caldwell: The visionary leader of the Spaceport Survivors, driven by the mission to
      revive space exploration.
- **Conflict:** The Spaceport Survivors are focused on their mission, but they are not immune to the intrigues and
  hidden agendas within the wasteland, particularly from the Enclave.
- **Goals for Spaceport**:
    - Equipped with resources from their recent alliance with the Lone Star Republic, the Spaceport Survivors are
      preparing for a historic manned rocket launch. This launch represents the culmination of their efforts to revive
      space exploration and continue humanity's legacy in the post-apocalyptic world. Their goals for the spaceport are
      multi-faceted:
        - Symbol of Progress: The Spaceport Survivors see the spaceport as a symbol of progress and hope, showcasing
          humanity's ability to overcome the challenges of the post-apocalyptic world and achieve great feats.
        - Space Exploration: The spaceport represents an opportunity to continue humanity's legacy of space exploration,
          potentially finding new resources or safe havens beyond the wasteland.
        - Repairing existing satellites: The Spaceport Survivors aim to repair existing satellites, in an attempt to
          improve communication across the world.
    - The [hidden Enclave cell](enclave.md#spaceport-enclave) within the Spaceport Survivors wish to hijack the mission (by way of placing crew members
      from within their own ranks) so to retake the 
      [Ballistic Orbital Missile Base 001](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ballistic_Orbital_Missile_Base_001).
      Capturing this station would give this Enclave cell the ability to launch nuclear missiles at any target on the
      planet. This would be a major threat to any and all the Enclave's enemies.

## History
### Before the Great War: The USSA Legacy

Before the Great War, the Johnson Space Center was the hub of United States space exploration. The USSA (United States Space Administration) had ambitious plans for the colonization of other planets and the exploration of the cosmos. Among the key figures in this pre-war era was Dr. Jonathan Caldwell, a brilliant scientist and astronaut who envisioned humanity's future beyond Earth.

Dr. Caldwell, along with his team, developed advanced space technologies, including experimental propulsion systems and sustainable life support systems. As the political tensions and nuclear threat escalated, Dr. Caldwell initiated a secret project known as "Project Celestial Ark." This project aimed to create a hidden vault beneath the Johnson Space Center, capable of sustaining a group of scientists, astronauts, and engineers to preserve humanity's spacefaring legacy.

### During the Great War: Vault 117 and the Celestial Ark

As the Great War unfolded, Dr. Caldwell and his team managed to complete Vault 117 just in time. The vault was designed not just as a conventional shelter but as a celestial ark with its own mission control center, rocket assembly facility, and experimental technologies. The spaceport's surface facilities endured a direct nuclear strike, causing devastation to the outer structures but leaving the underground vault intact.

The inhabitants of Vault 117, carefully selected for their expertise and dedication to space exploration, witnessed the destruction of the world above. Dr. Caldwell, knowing the importance of preserving humanity's knowledge of space, set in motion a plan to secretly continue space exploration even in the post-apocalyptic wasteland.

### Post-Great War: The Spaceport Survivors Emerge

For over two centuries, the Spaceport Survivors thrived in their underground haven. Descendants of the original vault dwellers, they maintained and upgraded the space infrastructure left behind by their forebears. The vault's advanced technology, combined with salvaged pre-war equipment, allowed them to launch unmanned rockets at regular intervals, conducting satellite maintenance and research.

### Modern Era

In 2280, over two hundred years after the Great War, Catherine "Stardust" Caldwell, descendent of the founding Dr. Jonathon Caldwell, was appointed as the new Director of the Mission Control and consequently the Overseer of the Vault itself. The Vault had continued to operate as a closed system, with no contact with the outside world, as directed by the original Vault-Tec program. However, as their supplies began to dwindle and the technology in orbit only continued to degrade in the harshness of space, Director Caldwell knew that without some form of change, the Spaceport would grow more desperate and unable to continue their mission.
