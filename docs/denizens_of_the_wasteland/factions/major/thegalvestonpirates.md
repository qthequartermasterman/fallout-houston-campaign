# Galveston Pirates

## Overview

- **Overview:** The Galveston Pirates are a formidable force controlling key ports along the Gulf Coast. They are known
  for their ruthless tactics and control over sea routes.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Port Control: They effectively control trade routes and access to valuable resources through their control of
      Galveston's ports.
    - Pirate Raids: The Galveston Pirates regularly raid ships and coastal settlements, accumulating wealth and
      resources by force.
- **Conflict:** The Galveston Pirates have an ongoing conflict with the Lone Star Republic, primarily over resource
  access. This rivalry fuels much of the region's instability.
- **Goals for Spaceport**:
    - The Galveston Pirates see the spaceport as a potential source of valuable resources, including advanced technology
      and materials. They aim to secure these resources by any means necessary, including raiding the spaceport or
      sabotaging the Lone Star Republic's efforts.
    - The Galveston Pirates also see the spaceport as a potential threat to their control over the region's ports and
      trade routes. They aim to prevent the Lone Star Republic from launching a manned rocket, which could give them a
      significant advantage in the wasteland. This could include sabotaging the launch or capturing the spaceport for
      themselves.
    - Although they are perfectly fine with the destruction of the spaceport, they would prefer to capture it for
      themselves. This would give them a significant advantage over the Lone Star Republic and the Spaceport Survivors, 
      especially after they hear about the [Ballistic Orbital Missile Base](./enclave.md#ballistic-orbital-missile-base-001).
- **Government**:
  The Galveston Pirates is a loose confederation of pirate crews, each led by a captain. There are efforts to better
  unify the pirates under a single banner, but these efforts find opposition.

  - Pirate King: The Pirate Code establishes that the pirates, during emergency, can be governed by a singular Pirate King. This position is currently vacant (and has always been, except during a brief period during the [Lone Star Republic-Cartel War (2255-2260)](./lonestarrepublic.md#the-lone-star-republic-cartel-war-2255-2260). The Pirate King is expected to be a unifying figure, capable of leading the pirates in times of crisis. The position remains vacant, because it requires a majority vote of the Council of Captains, and except during the aforementioned period, no captain has ever voted for someone other than himself.
  - High Leadership: The Galveston Pirates are governed by a Council of Captains, each leading crews with similar interests.
    - Captain Redhawk - The Naval Strategist:
        - Background: Redhawk was a skilled naval tactician before the Great War. Exposure to radiation during the nuclear fallout transformed him into a ghoul, granting him an extended lifespan. Witnessing the chaos, he gathered remnants of the naval forces, leveraging his strategic prowess to form the Galveston Pirates.
        - Party Representation: Represents the faction's native Houstonians and those with a military background. His longevity as a ghoul is a testament to his resilience and determination to restore order to the seas. He tends to resist the increasing influence of the Cartels, preferring to maintain the faction's independence. But he does support the Pirates' confederation efforts, recognizing the benefits of a unified front.
    - Captain Mariposa - The Cartel Diplomat:
        - Background: Mariposa, a former Cartel member, orchestrated a successful coup against the previous leader, seizing control of the Cartel's smuggling operations. Seeking new opportunities, he allied with Redhawk to ensure the Cartel's interests were maintained within the Galveston Pirates.
        - Party Representation: Represents the Cartel interests within the faction. Mariposa's recent rise to power adds an element of intrigue and potential internal conflict within the Galveston Pirates.
    - Captain Ironsides - The Ruthless Raider:
        - Background: Ironsides was a feared raider in the post-apocalyptic wasteland. A skilled technician and survivor, he enhanced his body with cybernetic implants over the years, making him a formidable force. Recognizing the potential of the Galveston Pirates, Ironsides joined forces with Redhawk, leveraging his cybernetic enhancements for the faction's benefit.
        - Party Representation: Represents the raider gangs and those who thrive on chaos. Ironsides' recent affiliation with the Galveston Pirates adds a modern and dynamic element to his character.
  - Lower Ranks: Crews have autonomy, and chaos often ensues as different captains pursue conflicting goals. The Code
  serves as a loose guideline, causing internal power struggles.
  - Unity Through Recent Alliances:
    - Forced Alliance: The recent rise of the three captains to power aligned with the changing landscape of the post-apocalyptic Gulf. Their unique skills and backgrounds converged, leading to the formation of the Council of Captains for the survival and prosperity of the Galveston Pirates.
  - The Code: The Code is a set of guidelines that all captains must follow. It is a loose set of rules that governs
    the Galveston Pirates, but it is often ignored or interpreted differently by different captains. The Code is
    enforced by the Council of Captains, but it is often difficult to enforce due to the chaotic nature of the pirates.
    1. Unity in Plunder: Pirates are expected to work together for the common benefit of the Galveston Pirates. This includes sharing resources, intelligence, and manpower for the overall success of the faction.
    2. Respect Among Captains: The captains, as leaders of their respective crews, are to show mutual respect and cooperation. Disputes between captains should be resolved through diplomacy or, if necessary, a designated mediator.
    3. No Betrayal Within the Ranks: Betrayal of fellow pirates is strictly forbidden. Any crew member found conspiring against the Galveston Pirates or their captains will face severe consequences, potentially including expulsion or even execution.
    4. Fair Division of Spoils: Loot and resources acquired through piracy, smuggling, or conquest are to be fairly divided among the crews. Any captain caught hoarding or withholding their share may face repercussions.
    5. Honoring Agreements: Agreements and alliances, whether with external factions or among the captains themselves, are to be honored. Breaking such agreements without just cause is considered a breach of the Pirate Code.
    6. Respect for Galveston Territory: The Galveston Docks and the surrounding territory are considered sacred to the Galveston Pirates. Internal conflicts or violent disputes among the crews should be kept away from this area to maintain order and security.
    7. Punishment for Lawbreakers: Violations of the Pirate Code, depending on their severity, may result in various punishments. Minor offenses may incur fines or reprimands, while more severe transgressions could lead to expulsion or even execution.
    8. Crew Autonomy: While unity is encouraged, individual crews have a degree of autonomy in their decision-making. Captains are responsible for the conduct of their crews, but they have the freedom to pursue their own initiatives within the broader goals of the Galveston Pirates.
    9. Adaptability in Warfare: Pirates should be adaptable in their tactics and warfare strategies. The post-apocalyptic world demands flexibility, and crews are expected to innovate and evolve to face new challenges.
    10. Redemption Through Service: A pirate who violates the code may have an opportunity for redemption through exemplary service or a significant contribution to the faction. This provision allows for a degree of forgiveness and encourages loyalty.

## History
1. The Great War (2077):
    The devastation of the Great War in 2077 plunged the world into chaos, and the Gulf Coast was no exception. The once-thriving city of Houston was left in ruins, and the survivors faced the harsh realities of the post-apocalyptic wasteland.
2. Post-War Chaos and Raider Gangs (2077 - 2255):
    In the aftermath of the Great War, Houston became a breeding ground for raider gangs and lawlessness. The lack of a centralized authority allowed these gangs to thrive, terrorizing the remaining population and vying for control over scarce resources. Among these raider gangs were many disparate Pirate crews, who would later form the Galveston Pirates. Each crew maintained its own ships and raided settlements along the coast, accumulating wealth and resources.
3. Lone Star Republic-Cartel War (2255 - 2260):
    The Lone Star Republic, in its early years, faced a formidable challenge from ruthless cartels that had seized control of Houston. The war, marked by fierce battles and strategic maneuvers, saw the emergence of key figures like Maria "Ironclad" Ramirez and Samuel Davis.
4. Formation of the Galveston Pirates (c. 2262):
    With Houston liberated and the Lone Star Republic focused on diplomatic and trade relations, certain elements within the city saw an opportunity for a different path. Former raider gangs, disillusioned settlers, and opportunistic individuals coalesced to form the Galveston Pirates. Captain Redhawk, a former naval officer, emerged as a key figure, leveraging his strategic prowess to unite many pirate crews under a single banner.
5. Council of Captains and the Pirate Code (2262):
    The Galveston Pirates adopted a loose hierarchy known as the Council of Captains, with leaders like Captain Redhawk and Captain Ironsides emerging as key figures. The Pirate Code was established to guide the behavior of the captains and their crews, emphasizing unity, respect, and adaptability.
6. Pseudo-War with the Lone Star Republic (2262-Ongoing):
    The Galveston Pirates, seeking independence and control over the Gulf of Mexico, entered into a pseudo-war with the Lone Star Republic. Tensions arose as the Pirates raided shipments and asserted their dominance, maintaining a delicate balance between conflict and cooperation.
7. Smuggling and Raids (2262-Ongoing):
    The Pirates thrived on piracy in the Gulf of Mexico, regularly raiding merchant and passenger ships heading to the Lone Star Republic and other settlements in the region. Additionally, they engaged in smuggling chems across the gulf on behalf of the Mexican Cartels, securing funds for their operations.
8. Cartel Involvement with the Galveston Pirates (2277):
    Recognizing the strategic importance of the Gulf region, the Mexican Cartels establish a clandestine partnership with the Galveston Pirates. The Cartels provide weaponry, including pipe and machined weapons from their pre-war factories, while the Pirates assist in smuggling chems across the Gulf. In the time since, the Cartels have increased their influence over the Pirates, leading to internal conflict. Captain Mariposa, a former Cartel member, has emerged as a key figure in this conflict, after orchestrating a successful coup against the previous Cartel representative. He has managed to secure a seat on the Council of Captains, ensuring the Cartel's interests are maintained within the Galveston Pirates.
9. Battleship Texas as Mobile Headquarters (2280):
    In 2280, with the assistance of the Cartels, the Galveston Pirates managed to get the ship operational again, and sailed it to its current location in the Galveston Docks. The ship was then renovated and is now the Galveston Pirates' primary (yet mobile) base of operations, and is used to launch raids on the Port of Houston and other settlements along the coast.
10. The Vault 117 Discovery (2288):
    Two centuries after the Great War, the Spaceport Survivors living in Vault 117 beneath the ruins of the Johnson Space Center continued their operations, launching unmanned rockets. The Galveston Pirates, misunderstanding these launches, destroyed one of the rockets, leading to the discovery of Vault 117 and the Spaceport Survivors.  The Galveston Pirates, intrigued by the technology and resources within Vault 117, attempted to infiltrate the vault. However, their actions triggered a wide-frequency distress broadcast from the Spaceport Survivors, seeking help from the Gulf Coast Wasteland.
