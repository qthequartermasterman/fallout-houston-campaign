  description: Leonard Petrovich, a formidable presence and a testament to the horrors of the wasteland, stands tall despite his ghoulified appearance. His once handsome features distorted by radiation, his skin peeling and mottled, Leonard commands attention with an undeniable air of authority. Though his once-chiseled features are now marred by the physical toll of his transformation, his piercing blue eyes shine with an unwavering intensity. He often wears a tailored charcoal gray suit, a stark contrast against his decaying flesh, a reminder of his aristocratic heritage and corporate success. Leonard's charismatic and jovial nature often puts others at ease, but when he enters the negotiation room, tension fills the air and his joviality gives way to a steely seriousness, revealing the depths of his calculated determination and commanding influence.
