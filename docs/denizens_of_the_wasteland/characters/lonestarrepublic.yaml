  description: President Samuel Davis is a rugged and imposing figure in the post-apocalyptic wasteland. Standing at 6 feet tall, he possesses a commanding presence with broad shoulders and a well-maintained physique that reflects his military background. Samuel's deep-set, steel-blue eyes radiate an air of authority, often leaving an indelible impression on those who meet him. His grizzled, salt-and-pepper hair and well-trimmed beard add to his distinguished appearance. Although the wasteland has aged him, it has also toughened him, and his weathered features tell the tale of a man who has faced the harsh realities of the new world.
