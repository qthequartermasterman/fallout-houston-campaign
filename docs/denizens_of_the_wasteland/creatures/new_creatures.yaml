  description: Rad-Gators are monstrous, mutated alligators that have adapted to the radioactive waters of the Houston bayous and swamps. They are larger and more aggressive than their pre-war counterparts, with gnarled, irradiated scales and glowing eyes.<br>They are ambush predators, often lurking just below the surface of murky waters, waiting to strike at unsuspecting prey. Their powerful jaws can deliver deadly bites.<br>Rad-Gators are most commonly found near bodies of water, making river crossings and swamp navigation perilous for unprepared travelers. They are especially common in the Buffalo Bayou.

    type: Normal
    exp: 38
    description: These creatures are the mutated descendants of the common deer. While they retain a mostly unchanged form in that their body remains deer-like and they sport antlers, they suffer the same mutation as brahmin in having two heads. The inner eye of each head is blind, requiring the radstag to navigate using both heads. Like brahmin, both heads can move independently. The other strange mutation that is very apparent is the additional two legs that hang undeveloped from the front of the creature’s chest. While the radstag can bend these legs when needed for comfort, such as when laying down, they are otherwise useless. While radstags still retain a coat, it is often mangey in places from radiation, and rabid radstags often lose their coat in places. These creatures travel in packs and are usually docile unless threatened.<br> <i>More details can be found in the Core Rulebook, pg 352.</i>

    description: These mutated longhorn cattle have retained their iconic long, curved horns, but they've grown to enormous sizes and have two heads. Texa-Bulls are hulking creatures with tough, mutated hides, often covered in patches of irradiated growths. They are territorial and protective of their herds. If provoked, Texa-Bulls charge at intruders with incredible force, making them a formidable threat in the open plains of Houston's wasteland, but they are otherwise docile. Texa-Bulls are primarily found in the open plains and fields, and their grazing grounds are often sought after by scavengers for the valuable mutated meat they provide. Many ranchers have successfully domesticated Texa-Bulls, and they are often used as pack animals and livestock. Many ranchers in the Gulf Coast Wasteland will run cattle drives, where they, with the help of cowboys, herd Texa-bulls and Brahmin north across the wasteland to sell in settlements or to load trains in territory controlled by Caesar's Legion.

    description: Mutated Monarch butterflies have developed unique characteristics due to exposure to radiation and the changed ecosystem. They might retain their distinctive orange and black coloration, but with subtle mutations like glowing patterns on their wings. These butterflies serve as symbols of hope and beauty in the wasteland. They do not attack players or other creatures, and when engaged, flee. Players might encounter them near pockets of surviving plant life or as they migrate through the region. Mutated Monarchs could be found in areas with surviving plant life, such as the remains of gardens or parks. They might also be found in the wild, migrating through the region. There are also rumors of a hidden colony of Mutated Monarchs in the ruins of the Houston Museum of Natural Science.
